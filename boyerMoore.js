But I want to try.To the Princess of Pin Oak Creek, fighting heart Jeannie GraceGoebel Rather—now my wife of 55 years. To her, a good-heartedwoman in love with a too often wrongheaded man, this book isowed—as is just about every good and decent thing I have everdone in my adult life.The pride of Winchester, Texas, she is both the prettiest andsmartest girl ever to come out of at least that part of the state. Bornat home there where the hardwood meets the pine along the banksof the Colorado River, her early school years were in a little one-room schoolhouse. She is the only woman I know who began in aone-room country school and grew up to conquer Washington,London and New York—not to mention Houston, Dallas and NewOrleans. And she did it while being an ideal wife (far better than Ideserved) and the mother of two wonderful, well-adjusted children.All the while she also determinedly pursued her childhood dream ofbeing an accomplished artist. She became one—a painter whoseworks have sold in galleries in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere.She is descended from Lone Star pioneer women who helpedstave off Indian raids and then beat out cabin fires with theirhusbands’ bloody shirts. She came not from wealth or privilege—herfamily had little land and was not of the archetypical cattle-herdingsort. She learned early how to pick cotton, how to milk a cow andhow to wring a chicken’s neck for Sunday dinner.Jean is in some ways a walking contradiction: patent leatheroutside but rawhide underneath. If you want to see her eyes narrow and the veins in her neck pulse, just try threatening her children orgrandchildren. Or her home and hearth in any way. (She’ll give mehell in private when she thinks I’ve done wrong, but doesn’t takekindly to anyone treating her man unfairly.)Gentle and kind by nature, in every storm of life she is oak andiron. Or, to paraphrase what the late Eric Sevareid once said inanother context, she’s the kind of woman you wouldn’t be afraid tohave your back on a tiger hunt. I still marvel at how lucky I am. PROLOGUEAloneCometotheedge,hesaid.Theysaid:Weareafraid.Cometotheedge,hesaid.They came.Hepushedthem…andtheyflew.APOLLINAIREIt’s a Friday evening in New York in the early spring of 2006. I’m inmy combined60 Minutes and60 Minutes II office at 555 West 57th,across the street from the old renovated milk barn that has beenCBS News world headquarters for many years. Out the window is aglorious view of the Hudson River, the view stretching across theriver and into the trees and rocks of New Jersey.There’s nobody else around. It is quiet as a tomb, and my mindbegins to wander: a kaleidoscope of thoughts. There are smiles,worries and concerns, and flashes of the past. I’ve been aprofessional journalist, a reporter, for 60 years, 44 of them at CBSNews, 24 of them as anchor and managing editor of theCBSEvening News—the network’s flagship broadcast. They called it“being the face and the voice” of CBS’s storied News Division. Withthe exception of Britain’s BBC, it was the best known and mosthonored broadcast news operation in the world.But that’s all in the past. As “the face and voice of CBS News,”Edward R. Murrow is long gone. So is Walter Cronkite. And so am I.This was supposed to be a new beginning for me, but it is feelingvery much like the beginning of the end. At least at CBS.I almost desperately don’t want it to be. I am still hoping againsthope that somehow, someway, things will work out and I can stay. In denial? Well, I don’t think so. But time and the tides are runningin that direction.An old friend who, like me, grew up working in the oilfields andrefineries of the Texas Gulf Coast as the son of an oilfield hand hadcalled a short while earlier. He’s been retired for a few years andcalled just to touch base, tell a few jokes and in general besupportive and encouraging.“Rags,” he finally said, using my father’s nickname that had beenpassed on to me in my youth. “You don’t want to face it, I know. Butyou’re finished there. They have decided to scapegoat you, throwyou to the wolves and be rid of you. They’re doing it to savethemselves. It ain’t fair or right, but it’s what is. And the sooner yourecognize it and deal with it, the better off you’re going to be.”He went on to say some overcomplimentary things about “what agreat reporter you’ve been… best of your time and one of the bestever… who’s given CBS News some of the best years they’ve everhad,” and so on. That kind of thing. But by this time, I had tunedhim pretty much out. My mind was racing and wandering.To hell with this, I was thinking. He’s a friend, naturally he’s goingto say those things. He means well, and I appreciate it. More thanhe can know. He’s trying to be helpful. But I know my weaknessesand strengths. This includes knowing, really knowing down deep,that I had wanted since childhood to do extended great reporting,work that might stand with the best of my time, if not the best ever.And I had not achieved that. Not nearly. Not yet. This is not falsehumility. It’s not humility of any kind. It’s how I genuinely feel.What I felt at this moment was that in the dream of doing thekind of reporting that I like best and believe I do best—big breakingnews, international stories including covering war zones and deep-digging investigative journalism—CBS News was the best place tobe. By far. I loved the place, loved the people and loved what CBSrepresented: an institution—not just a great corporation, but aninstitution important to the country and to the cause of pressfreedom everywhere.That last part may strike some people as overstated. It neverstruck me that way. About that, I was a true believer. I also loved the history and tradition of the place, which I knewwell. There may well have been (probably have been) better, muchbetter CBS News correspondents than I over the years, but there’snever been one who knew the history of the place better. I alsoloved the lore, the mythology and high sense of mission exuded bythe CBS I had known. I loved it all when I was a young reporter justbreaking in with the network. And I loved it even more now that Iwas an older man. I was now 74, and age had given me an evengreater appreciation of how lucky I was to have spent most of mycareer at CBS.But age also had given me perspective. Try as I had, and I hadtried hard—I gave it everything I knew how—I knew within myselfthat the dream of doing sustained great work, work that would berecognized as truly important and a service to my country, was notcompleted.Sure, I’ve had my good days—big interviews, world-classexclusive stories, breaking news and long, good reporting runs onbig stories and the like. But I also know how often I’ve failed,haven’t been as good as I could have, should have been. And abody, a lifetime, of great journalistic work? No, not yet. I’m workingon it though, still striving, still trying, still determined, still chasingthe childhood dream. And I want to do it here at CBS News—myhome for most of my professional life.“Never, never, ever give up,” I was thinking as my old Texasfriend’s voice tailed off. (My father had quoted Winston Churchill’sfamous line so often that it had become rote to me long ago.)And besides, I was thinking, I know this business and I knowthese people, the people of CBS News. And the people at the top ofCBS corporate. We have, almost literally, been to hell and backtogether over the years, through good times and bad, throughsunshine and storms. I trust them and they trust me. This trust hasbeen tested time and again. It’s been forged to strong steel in hotfires, past and present, over nearly half a century. We’ll find a way towork it out. If nothing else, we will just will it to happen.Was it hubris? Naïveté? Did I have my head in the sand? Lookingback on it, maybe some or all of that. But I didn’t think so at the time.What I did think, what I knew, was that I was feeling deeplytroubled. Among the things troubling me most (and there were a lotof things) was that some longtime colleagues at CBS had turnedagainst me. Some of these people I had considered to be friends.Some were people whom I had hired, mentored, promoted and/orhelped in various ways professionally. Fair to say that some of themhad helped me along the way, too. Helped a lot. Couldn’t have,wouldn’t have done it without their help.On the other hand, some good friends were standing tall andstanding by me. And there were other people whom I didn’t knowwell who did the same. I shouldn’t have been surprised. It’s an oldstory: When the heat’s on and you need someone to stand with you,those who you most expect will don’t, and those who you leastexpect do. But surprised I was, by those who did and by those whodidn’t.The worst were those who, after pretending to be friends for allthose years, stealthily snuck around giving anonymous newspaperquotes and otherwise scheming to put the dirk in deep when I wasdown and hurting.One of them, a veteran news executive who was one of the mostpublicly lauded men in the craft and for whom I had worked sincefirst coming to CBS, made a series of secret telephone calls tonewspaper writers lambasting me personally and professionally—allunder the cover of “don’t use my name,” of course.But, hey, I said to myself, this is the big time; you’ve beenprivileged to play the game at the top for a long while. These are themajor leagues: Envy, cowardice and betrayal are part of life. Stuffhappens, and people will always surprise you; take it for what youcan learn from it and take it like a man, like a pro. And just keep onkeeping on. Which is what I was trying to do.They pushed me out, but before I knew it, I was flying again. CHAPTER 1Abu GhraibWhy was I out at CBS? Because I reported a true story. The story Ireported in September 2004 of President George W. Bush’sdereliction of duty during Vietnam is true, and neither Bush himselfnor anyone close to him—no family member, no confidante, nopolitical ally—has ever denied it. I remain proud of reporting thattruth, and proud of the many people who were part of that report.Looking back and reflecting on it, if shining a light on Bush’sunexplained absence during his stint in the Texas Air National Guardwas the story that got me pushed out of CBS, the first strongindication of trouble had come four months earlier, over a story Ireported on60 Minutes II in April 2004. As a journalist, my coreprinciple—my duty—has always been to get to the truth. This,however, was a story nobody wanted to be true: the story of howsome American military personnel were humiliating, abusing andtorturing Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison.The duties of a journalist, however, do not stop with uncoveringthe truth. Absent compelling reasons of national security—which isvery different from political embarrassment (at least it should be)—journalists also have a responsibility to inform the public about thetruths they discover. And my determination to fulfill this obligationabout Abu Ghraib became a very big problem (and, I suspect, apolitical embarrassment) for the management of CBS and for itscorporate parent, Viacom. At the height of the Iraq war, I was a frequent flyer to Baghdad.From the war’s beginning in March 2003 to March 2004, I’d beenthere at least four times. On one of the early visits, I learned thatthe prison known as Abu Ghraib had been taken over by the U.S.Army. Refurbished and redubbed the Baghdad Central CorrectionalFacility, by the fall of 2003 it was being used to house those we hadtaken prisoner. The inmates were a mixed lot—some commoncriminals, some folks who were just in the wrong place at the wrongtime and some considered to be “high value” prisoners suspected ofleading the insurgency or participating in terrorist activities.The name change didn’t alter its reputation. Whatever you calledit, Abu Ghraib was notorious. Under Saddam Hussein, it had beenfeared by all as a chamber of horrors, a gulag, if you will. Prisonerswere maimed, raped and tortured. Many were also murdered, or atleast presumed murdered. After being incarcerated there, they hadvanished without a trace. The prison was trashed and looted by theIraqis themselves during our invasion; Americans who had seen theinterior immediately after our soldiers took Baghdad reportedgruesome scenes of bodies mauled by dogs and electrodes comingout of the walls. Eventually, we would recover videotape shot by U.S.troops on the day they entered the prison. The tape showed squalor,filth and an incredibly unsafe area for American soldiers to be living,but this is where they were housed while they worked to rebuild andreclaim the facility for use by the U.S. military.I had a more personal connection to Abu Ghraib as well. Duringthe Gulf War in the early 1990s, Saddam’s forces had captured oneof our CBS correspondents, an outstanding journalist named BobSimon. Bob and I have been friends and colleagues for more than 35years. He is one of the best, most experienced foreigncorrespondents of his generation. A graduate of Brandeis University,he is brilliant, analytical and a swift, sure writer. And he has guts. Hisbravery is legendary among his peers. He could have held his ownwith the Murrow Boys of World War II. Bob and I had been in manyof the same bad datelines and tight places—often at the same time—over the years: Vietnam, Lebanon, Gaza, the West Bank, Baghdadand others. He is, as many of the best foreign correspondents are, a bit of a loner, but every inch a gentleman and a scholar. He’sgenerous, compassionate and friendly, loyal and protective of thosewho work with him and for him (especially camera crews,technicians and producers in the field). But he leans toward beingtaciturn, doesn’t always talk a lot and stays to himself and withinhimself—more than most people in television news.Bob was held prisoner for 40 days, and for part of that time hewas in Abu Ghraib. We feared greatly for his safety. All of us at CBSworked every contact we had around the world to get him released.I was one of several who spoke with former secretary of state HenryKissinger, asking him to intercede. Whatever else you may think ofKissinger, his involvement finally set Bob free.On several of my trips to Baghdad, I had asked about the “new,improved” Abu Ghraib, and it always seemed curious to me thateveryone made an extraordinary effort to be unresponsive, if notdownright evasive. It was as if they wanted to keep what was goingon there a secret. I found this odd, since it was being touted as ashowplace of a modern correctional facility as part of its imagemakeover. Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, who oversaw AbuGhraib (as well as 14 other prisons and detention centers in Iraq),had given Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld a photo-op tour ofthe facility in September 2003, pointing out the newly installedceiling fans, toilets, showers and medical center. In October, sheassured60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft that those interned inAbu Ghraib were receiving “the best care available.” At about thesame time, President Bush trumpeted to supporters at a RepublicanParty gala that Iraq was now “free of rape rooms and torturechambers.” Two months later, General Karpinski told theSt.Petersburg Times that “living conditions now are better in prisonthan at home. At one point we were concerned they [the prisoners]wouldn’t want to leave.”Given all the hoopla, I found it peculiar that when I asked to visitthe prison, I was told in no uncertain terms to forget about it. Imade a mental note but wasn’t able to follow up at the time. Then,in late 2003, an Iraqi I had known for more than a decadeapproached me. “Mr. Rather,” he said, “you really ought to do something about Abu Ghraib. Bad things are going on there.” I madeanother mental note, but time pressures forced me to put the matteraside.There is a time-honored saying in management: “When you start anenterprise, pick eagles. Then teach them to fly in formation.” At60Minutes II, Mary Mapes was one of our very best eagles. She washead of the unit under me and was ever so capable in multiple roles—lead reporter, writer, investigator, producer. She had a great nosefor a story and was outstanding under the pressure of writingagainst deadline. Working with her was another eagle, an associateproducer named Dana Roberson. At CBS then and at HDNet now,one of Dana’s jobs when she’s not on deadline is to make phonecalls to develop and cultivate long-term sources. That means stayingin touch with people who have helped you in the past, just in casethey come across something again. Anyone who’s worked with mewill tell you that I’m a telephone person (as contrasted with an e-mail person, which I surely am not). It may be old-fashioned, butI’m a believer in working your Rolodex and getting in touch withpeople by phone. “Hi, Dan Rather here. Just checking in. Anythinggoing on I should know about?”Over the years, I had cultivated a network of contacts about Iraq,both here in the States and in the Middle East. Dana and Mary had,of course, developed their own. One of Dana’s contacts was a well-connected source in the U.S.-led Iraq operation with whom she hadbuilt up an excellent rapport.Early in 2004 he called to tell her he had something that couldbecome “the mother of all stories.” He laid out the story of a numberof U.S. soldiers who had been arrested and charged with prisonerabuse. That past January there had been a bland press release fromCentral Command (CENTCOM) announcing that an officialinvestigation was under way, but Dana’s source suggested that ithad mushroomed into something much larger. After hearing what hehad to say, Mary, Dana and I all realized it was likely that there wasan even more explosive story behind these allegations. There was strong evidence that the acts of abuse that these enlisted men andnoncommissioned officers were accused of committing had beenundertaken in response to orders from higher up the chain ofcommand. In other words, the U.S. Department of Defense wasencouraging the mistreatment and perhaps torturing of prisoners.Dana’s persistence with her sources had led to a tip on a majorstory. This is the way good reporters work, and Dana was good. Shehad just proven it once again. Mary and Dana flew out to meet withour source, who confirmed what he had said on the phone. Not onlywas there widespread prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, but there werephotographs. Lots of photographs. He couldn’t actually give themthe pictures, nor could he specifically name names. What he did do,however, was give Mary and Dana a nugget of information that ledto some clues about how to dig deeper into the story. He hinted thatthey should look into the rotation of units that had been assigned toAbu Ghraib. He indicated that the soldiers who had been arrested allbelonged to the same unit. Their unit had now been rotatedstateside, but the soldiers facing charges had been left behind inBaghdad.After Dana and Mary brought this new information to me, westarted pursuing it relentlessly. Mary began contacting her ownsources. Dana started reaching out to more of her contacts. I spreadout with mine. Early in March 2004, I actually went to Abu Ghraib, atleast to the exterior. It was an incredible scene at the gate—hundreds, maybe thousands of people were outside, desperatelyholding up photos and clamoring for information about loved oneswho had been incarcerated. I spoke with some of them, but myrequest for an interview with General Karpinski was stonewalled byher office, and no, I couldn’t get a tour of the prison, either. Now myjournalistic antennae were really starting to twitch.The clues from the source were helpful, which didn’t mean it waseasy. Roger Charles, our military consultant, was involved in theinvestigation from the beginning. As a retired U.S. Marine colonel,Roger knew the ins and outs of tracking unit movement in anybranch of the armed forces. In the beginning it was like looking for aneedle in a haystack, but by tracking the assignments of various units that had recently served at the prison, we were able to starteliminating some units and targeting others.We started with a huge circle of possibilities and began to drawthe circle tighter and tighter. Mary, Dana and Roger stalked theInternet; if a given unit was within the time frame and area ofassignment, they looked up everybody whose name they could find,tracked them down and asked them about arrests or abuse or anysoldiers from the unit who had not come home with the rest of theirteam.At first, progress was agonizingly slow. There were many deadends, but we were able to glean just enough bits of information tokeep us going. We were a long way from having the whole story, butwe were getting more and more signs that therewas a story, and abig one.In addition to knowing how to track particular units, RogerCharles had great ideas about how to reach out to their individualmembers. Almost every unit that had come home from Iraq had itsown website, a place where friends could post comments—a placewhere we could troll for names to contact about possible arrests,etc. Eventually this technique allowed Roger, Mary and Dana tonarrow the search down to a single unit. The times and dates allmatched up—it absolutely had to be the one. And they kept gettinga sort of backhanded confirmation that they were right—wheneverthey called to various members of the unit, they were hung up on,led astray, lied to or cussed out. For a reporter, that’s always a signthat you’re on the right track. A few people fessed up that somesoldiers had not come home with the rest of the unit because therehad been a “problem.”As Mary reported in her excellent bookTruth and Duty, our firstbig break came in late March after she put the word out on awebsite called Soldiers for the Truth (which has now become Standfor the Troops, sftt.org), looking for anyone willing to come forwardwith more information. Established by Colonel David Hackworth,Soldiers for the Truth was a resource for men and women on activeduty in the armed services. Still is. Its primary mission is to ensurethat troops get high-quality combat gear, such as body armor and helmets, but it also functions as a powerful, instantaneousinformation exchange.Roger Charles had suggested this approach as a way to reach outto family members of soldiers in the unit. We were looking forsomeone—anyone—willing to speak with us. At the time, we had nonames of individuals, only the name of the unit. What we did knowis that we couldn’t go through official military channels. That wouldonly alert them that we were working on the story, which wouldcause them to choke off any further access to information.Within a day, a man named Bill Lawson responded to Mary’squery. His nephew, Staff Sergeant Ivan “Chip” Frederick, an Armyreservist, had been a guard at Abu Ghraib. In January 2004, he’dbeen one of the first to be interrogated as part of the Army’s officialinvestigation. In March, the rest of his unit had returned to theStates, but Frederick was still in Baghdad, pretty much under housearrest, awaiting court martial on multiple counts of prisoner abuse.Lawson was afraid that the Army was gearing up to let the little guysat Abu Ghraib—the enlisted men and noncoms who served as MPs—take the fall for abuse that the higher-ups had not only condonedbut encouraged or even requested… soldiers like his nephew Chip.Lawson had found his way to Hackworth’s website because he’dbeen casting an ever-wider net in his effort to reach out to anyonehe thought might help. He had been trying desperately to publicizeChip’s plight by getting someone’s attention in government, both inthe military and in Congress. He wrote to countless congressmenand Army officials. He had even contacted Bill O’Reilly and the RedCross, but apparently no one had responded.Mary, Dana and I went into overdrive. There wasn’t a moment tolose. Through Lawson, a telephone interview with Chip Frederickwas quickly arranged. Although he was being detained in Baghdad,he still was afforded the privilege of speaking with family at home.Family, of course, did not include CBS News. If the military got windthat he was talking to us, he’d be put in lockdown.To help maintain the cover, we set up the call from Chip Fredericknot to New York, but to my home in Austin, Texas. Cameras werearranged. Mary and I juggled our schedules to get there; I spoke with Frederick by phone on March 25. He admitted his participationin the abuse. Perhaps more important, he also laid out a shockingand chaotic scenario of conditions within the prison. Security waslax; he’d been shot at within the confines of Abu Ghraib, and therounds had come frominside a cell. The prison was overcrowdedand understaffed. There were too many prisoners, too few guards.Perhaps worst of all, there was little if any direction from the top.“We had no support, no training whatsoever,” Frederick told me. “Ikept asking my chain of command for certain things, like rules andregulations, and it just wasn’t happening.” He indicated that he hadnot seen a copy of the Geneva Convention untilafter he’d beencharged with prisoner abuse.Frederick volunteered that the Army was not the only Americanpresence in Abu Ghraib. Representatives of OGAs (othergovernmental agencies), as well as civilian defense contractors werepresent, and these individuals, not soldiers, had taken the lead inprisoner interrogation. “We had military intelligence, we had all kindsof other governmental agencies, FBI, CIA… that I didn’t even knowor recognize,” he said. Frederick also told me that he and others hadbeen explicitly encouraged, particularly by those in the OGAs, to gobeyond what was customarily expected of prison guards and hadeven been commended by military intelligence for their help in“softening up” prisoners in advance of their interrogation. “We’vehad a very high rate with our style of getting them to break,” he toldme with a hint of pride.Frederick indicated that at least one prisoner had died duringquestioning. He believed that the man had been beaten while underinterrogation by men from an OGA—CIA operatives, Frederickthought. Fearing a riot, guards had smuggled the corpse out of AbuGhraib on a gurney, an IV placed in the lifeless arm, to mislead otherprisoners into believing he was still alive. For an extra dose of“reality,” they had administered heart compressions—CPR—to thedead man until they were out of the compound.When he said this, the horrified look on Mary’s face said it all. Thelook on my face said nothing whatsoever. It couldn’t—I was oncamera, and I had to rein in my dismay. It was by no means easy, but I had to maintain my poker face. Because this would likely be hislast chance to speak publicly about what had happened withoutmilitary censorship, I had to continue to draw information out ofChip Frederick—without letting on that this was huge.But huge it was, and once the interview was concluded, Mary andI retreated to a nearby restaurant to talk it over. Rosie’s TamaleHouse, on the outskirts of Austin, is one of my favorite haunts.Before getting a table, we headed down Highway 71 to the closestgas-and-shop for some beer—after that interview, both of us wantedsomething a little stronger than our usual iced sun tea and Diet DrPepper. (Rosie’s doesn’t serve alcohol, but you’re allowed to bringyour own—at least, if you know her well.)Once inside the family-friendly retreat that is Rosie’s, both of usexhaled deeply. We were a bit shell-shocked by Frederick’srevelations. Over a cold beer—or two—and a hot tamale—or two—we tried to make sense of it.“So it’s true,” I said. “I wish it were not, but it is. And it’s a lotworse than we thought. This is one helluva story.”Mary stared into the bubbles in her beer. “Yeah.”“This one will be trouble with a capital ‘T,’ ” I continued. “A lot ofpeople are not going to believe this, and many of them who dowon’t really want to hear it.”“Soooo… Mary left the word hanging in the air, putting it on me tofinish the sentence. She was trying to gauge whether I was willing togo forward, knowing the major blowback that was sure to follow ifwe did.“So… So this is what we in journalism are supposed to do,” I saidsimply.Mary just nodded. I doubt whether my response surprised her inthe slightest. “If it were easy,” I continued, “everyone would bedoing it. You and I both know that none of us do it often enough.”“Gut check,” she replied softly.Gut check indeed. We both knew that nobody handles a story likethis and comes out unscathed. The gut check comes in when youask yourself whether you’re willing to pay the price for uncoveringthe truth. I heard the refrain in my brain: “Do this kind of work and there’s always a price to be paid. Except you can’t know—until thestory is out there—what the price will be.”I’d had any number of conversations like this over the years,going all the way back to my days as a reporter just starting out inHuntsville, Texas. Sometimes these conversations were with myself;most times they were with colleagues. They were always overstories that mattered, stories where the choices I made changed theoutcome and also changed me, both as a journalist and as a humanbeing. The first was a racially charged high-profile murder case. Thesecond was coverage of Martin Luther King and the early stages ofthe civil rights movement. And, much later, there was Watergate.All of these gut check debates had ended the same way: Whatmattered was getting to the truth, or as close to the truth ashumanly possible. The public’s right to know—our right to know—what was being done in our name, in our country’s name, wasparamount.Despite the fallout that was bound to come from running thestory, we knew we had to go forward. It was just too important.There was surely a terrifying risk that going public might mean thatAmericans captured or kidnapped would be treated differently. Therewas the same risk innot going forward with the story. Hostile forcesaware of the ongoing abuse would feel justified in using the sametechniques on Americans they took as prisoners.Going public was the only way to make the abuses stop. It wastime for us to sit down again with Jeff Fager, the executive producerof60 Minutes II. Jeff had been kept informed on what we werefinding out as we were going along, but now we were facing someweighty issues with major implications.Fager is a Colgate graduate and the son of a Boston physician. Hehad started out in radio and worked his way up into networktelevision. He is of medium height and weight with dark hair, sturdyof build—typical of the college skier he had been. His sense ofhumor and easy, regular laugh gives the impression that he mighthave been as interested in fraternity parties as he was class duringcollege. Whether that’s true or not, I knew him to be a good guywith whom to have a beer, a guy who knew how to have a good time. He can be, often is, a charmer. I also knew Jeff to be quick-smart and a very good producer of news stories. He’s not the bestwriter—often the mark of a really good producer—but whatever helacked as a writer, he made up for in his nose for a good story, hisdrive to get it and his knowledge of how to put it together.Jeff was a friend and protégé of CBS News president AndrewHeyward. The two had worked together at WCBS, our New YorkO&O. (An O&O is a local television station that is owned andoperated by the network, as opposed to an affiliate, which isindependently owned.) I had given Heyward his first opening in theNews Division, bringing him in as a producer shortly after I becameanchor of theCBS Evening News. Heyward then brought Jeff onboard. Heyward helped and looked after Fager, but Fager was notdependent on him. Jeff made and earned most of his own breaks.Having Heyward in his corner certainly didn’t hurt, but that alonewould not have gotten Jeff to60 Minutes as a producer, which heeventually became. And he was a good one, in a very competitiveenvironment.Andrew Heyward became a star producer atEvening News andeventually was nominated to become executive producer. At the timeI had, by contract, consultation and veto power over who would holdthat position. Regarding Andrew, I was in complete agreement. Iwas totally comfortable with him. By this time I had worked with himfor a number of years, both when he was a producer for theEveningNews and later when he became the first executive producer of48Hours (which I had helped to create). He had done outstanding work(which didn’t exactly make me look bad, since I had hired him); Ithought he deserved the spot.Not everyone shared my high opinion of him. There were thosewithin the company who considered Andrew a classic overambitiousclimber, a “too much, too fast” Harvard man with an Ivy Leagueentitlement complex who somehow believed he deserved to moveahead quickly, whatever his personal merits. They also said he was achild of television—which was not intended as a compliment. Andrewhad come into television right out of college, with no experience as a reporter in print or anywhere else. Several others had expressed theopinion that he had no real loyalties except to himself.But I was having none of that. I had hired him, he had provedhimself repeatedly and I believed in him, not only as a professional,but as a person. Not only had I no reason to doubt him in any way,professionally or personally, I had every reason to trust him andbelieve in him. Heyward was unquestionably bright, if not brilliant.He was experienced, and I thought he had proved himself to beloyal—always a prime requisite with me. I had no qualms aboutAndrew.Was I influenced by the fact that he often praised me, my talentand my work ethic to others? In retrospect, maybe. It’s no secretthat news anchors like to hear these things perhaps more than mostpeople, television anchoring being an egocentric line of work, to saythe least. But I believed then and believe now that Heyward meantthose things when he said them. I also thought, then and now, thathe was appreciative of the break I gave him in first getting him toCBS News.He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Harvard. Sometimesgraduates of places like Sam Houston State Teachers College (as Iam) don’t mesh with the top graduates of schools such as Harvard.When this happens, it probably has as much to do with feelings ofinferiority on the part of the little school graduate as it does with anyfeelings of superiority that are sometimes harbored by Ivy Leaguers.But there was none of that between us. Heyward and I meshed well.We always had. I had no doubts about him and, as far as I knew, hehad none about me. We were about 20 years apart in age, but in myview we were two pros with respect for each other and a job to do.And Andrew did his new job, as executive producer of theEvening News, well from the beginning. There was one surprise: Hewanted to bring in his old compadre Jeff Fager, who was then at60Minutes, as his second-in-command—our senior producer. Thismeant, in effect, vaulting Fager over several hardworking peoplealready on theEvening News team—qualified, diligent producerswho had stood in line for a long time, waiting their turn. I hadnothing against Fager; I didn’t know him well at the time. I did know that he got high marks from his peers at60 Minutes, but theleapfrogging factor concerned me.Andrew argued hard for him, pointing out that fresh talent fromoutsideEvening News could be a good—even necessary—thing, andthat he would work especially diligently to have the rest of the staffunderstand. I was not completely convinced. I was by no meansconfident that Jeff would be good for the program, or that theremainder of the staff would “understand.” But Andrew leaned hardon our personal relationship to persuade me. “You’re looking to meto deliver for you, Dan, and to do that I need someone who I cancount on to deliver for me—and us,” he argued. “And Jeff Fager isthat person. Give him a chance. You’ll like him and what he does.”And I did. I liked Jeff, and I liked his work. He and Andrew were agood fit; they worked together hand-in-glove fashion. It turned outto be good for them, good for me and good for the newscast. Wethree worked together well as a team.Then Heyward was moved up to become president of CBS News,a sudden promotion that was a triumph of the old school tie. AHarvard pal of his was a member of the top management teambrought in to run CBS when the network was sold to a newcorporation (Westinghouse), and he gave a boost to his old friend.When that happened, Heyward wanted Fager to succeed him asexecutive producer of theEvening News.He did. For Jeff, however, theEvening News was a stepping-stone. When60 Minutes II was created in 2000, he wanted tobecome its executive producer. Badly. With Heyward and me both inhis corner, Fager got the60 Minutes II top job. He did it well. I wasthe lead correspondent for the weekly program, in addition tocontinuing my daily duties as the longtime anchor of theEveningNews. And we were now—Mary Mapes and I—in Fager’s office. Itwas time to have a real honesty hour about Abu Ghraib.“We know it’s terrible,” I said. “Mary, Dana and I don’t know thefull extent of it yet, but we have almost enough to go with.”The major issue was the photographs. We all wanted them andtalked about how we might get them. As I recall, Fager said that weneeded the images to be able to air the piece. Chip Frederick said he did not have them, but he knew they existed and he knew what theycontained, because they were the basis of the abuse charges againsthim. CENTCOM’s official investigation, led by Major General AntonioTaguba, had been ordered after one of Frederick’s fellow MPs hadturned in a disc containing the photos to the Army’s CID.Within the Army, CID had responsibility for investigating potentialcriminal activity; its Iraq headquarters were actually at Abu Ghraib.Thanks to digital technology, however, multiple copies of the photoswere already in circulation far beyond the CID. Guards in the prisonhad passed them around among themselves and had even uploadedthem to send home.Mary and Dana worked the phones trying to get the photographs.Eventually their sources passed them on to other sources. On April9, we received about a dozen images. It took a real act of will toopen the envelope. The photos were as graphic as they wereheartbreaking. We looked them over in stunned silence. A hoodeddetainee stood on a box, electrical wires attached to his hands.There was an additional wire snaking up under his gown, whichapparently had been hooked to his penis. Some had been piled,naked, into a human pyramid and photographed from the rear.Others had been posed in simulated sex acts as guards pointed totheir private parts and grinned at the camera.We showed Jeff Fager the photos, expecting to get the greenlight to air the piece, but apparently he still needed more. Fagerseemed edgy, testy and out of sorts. He seemed aggressive andchallenging. He expressed no appreciation for what we’d done,which we all found to be out of character. It was my belief that hewas reacting to pressure from Andrew Heyward. There was now nodoubt whatsoever that we had everything necessary to put the storyon the air. We had hard evidence: eyewitness testimony, secondhandtestimony and photographs we knew to be authentic. We had aworld-class all-media scoop; as far as I knew, no one else even hada sniff of it.And management treated us as if we had just dragged a dead ratinto the newsroom. At CBS News, time was when getting the worldwide exclusive onan explosive story like Abu Ghraib would have been occasion forcongratulations and great praise from top executives, both of theNews Division and the network itself. Those times were long gone.From the days of Edward R. Murrow through civil rights, throughVietnam, through Watergate and into the 1980s, reporting the truth,regardless of who was trying to cover it up—or perhapsbecause ofwho was trying to cover it up—was a virtue unto itself and neededno further justification.This fundamental doctrine was handed down from CBS patriarchWilliam S. Paley himself. At Paley’s memorial service in 1990, it wassaid of him that “as caring as Bill was of his friends, he did not allowthat commitment to infringe on his love affair with CBS. While Iknew him, he was impervious to the many appeals that reached himto intervene with CBS News. Bill took the position that the CBS Newsteam was beyond his reach, because it was simply the best and themost dedicated group of journalists that had ever been assembled.”The eulogist was Henry Kissinger. Bill Paley simply believed thatthe news was the news and that reporting it was a public service—even during the early 1960s, when we started kicking up a lot ofdust with our coverage of the civil rights movement. We were called“outside agitators”; we were called the “Colored BroadcastingSystem.” Even some of our own southern affiliates tried to avoidcarrying the national newscast, because what we were showing wastoo inflammatory and too controversial—and it made white peoplelook bad.Paley, however, wasn’t having any of it. To him it smacked ofpoliticization of the news. The fact that our southern stations weresqueamish (or worse) about airing footage of blacks being attackedwith fire hoses and billy clubs was no reason for self-censorship. Atthe time, Paleywas CBS, and he ran the network as a benevolentdictatorship. When these affiliates started pushing, he pushed back,despite his awareness that powerful forces in Washington wereapplying pressure as well. Southern senators who were upset withour coverage were threatening to go for our jugular—which for amedia enterprise is almost always accessed through the wallet. Now, however, instead of kudos from corporate, I got the verystrong sense from both Fager and Heyward that they really didn’twant to run the story. The excuses were essentially a retread of thesame old argument: The story was too inflammatory, toocontroversial—and it made Viacom/CBS look bad. I also got thefeeling they were responding to heavy outside pressure, pressurethat came from inside Black Rock (CBS corporate headquarters) andpossibly from inside the Beltway.The relationship between government and the media—and thelarge corporations that own the media—will always be complex, inpart because media giants will always need something fromgovernment: license renewals, permission to expand, etc. For a verylong time, national networks such as CBS were allowed to own andoperate a maximum of six stations—own and operate them, asopposed to being affiliated by contract with local stations. The limiton O&Os was the Federal Communications Commission’s way ofensuring that no individual corporation could monopolize thecountry’s airwaves. Naturally, the networks claimed their six in thenation’s biggest markets—New York, LA, Chicago, etc.—but thenetworks always wanted more, much more.And beginning in the 1980s, they got it. Through campaigncontributions and heavy lobbying, big media corporations succeededin getting the FCC to loosen the restraints. The FCC is made up ofpolitical appointees, who generally do whatever the party in powerwants them to do. First the maximum rose from six into the teens.Then, as corporations got bigger and their political influence grew,that was expanded to 20 and more, and then revised upward fromthere. Once the floodgates opened, these changes resulted inenormous new profits for the networks, not just for CBS/Viacom, butfor the others as well.Big media is big business. Virtually all major networks are nowowned by large conglomerates whose reach extends beyondcommunications into many other industries as well. General Electric,which owns NBC, MSNBC and CNBC (among many other news andentertainment properties), is in addition a big defense contractor anda major provider of commercial lending, both of which are heavily dependent on positive relationships in Washington. Disney, whichowns ABC and ESPN, also owns amusement parks, resorts and avariety of other businesses, both at home and abroad, that can behindered—or stimulated—by action in Washington, either throughlegislation or government regulation.Government needs media as well. They use us to publicize someactivities; by the same token, they would much prefer it if we ignoreothers. This symbiotic relationship between media and governmentdoes not serve the public well. When I say that big business is inbed with big government, it is for their mutual benefit, not for thebenefit of the public interest. At the time Abu Ghraib was breaking,CBS and its parent company Viacom were already in hot water withthe FCC for Janet Jackson’s “wardrobe malfunction” during the SuperBowl halftime show. From a corporate standpoint, we werevulnerable.And corporate, apparently, was now running the show. I wasnever told outright not to run the piece. Instead, the News Divisionexecutives kept moving the goalposts, as it were, adding moreprerequisites before they would permit it to air. There had alreadybeen any number of obstacles placed in our way, and we hadovercome each and every one of them. Now Mary and I were toldthat we needed to get the Army’s reaction. Jeff Fager delivered themessage, but I believed that on a story of this magnitude, the orderwould have originated with Andrew Heyward. We couldn’t run thepiece without offering the Army the opportunity to give its version ofthe story.I had learned from hard experience that this was a bad idea. Itwould give both the Pentagon and the executive branch theopportunity to throw up delay after delay, sprinkle disinformation,send us on wild goose chases and prepare a massive pushback onour sources in order to get them to change their stories. In myopinion, the Department of Defense had already been deliberatelystonewalling and hiding this story for a long while. Cooling our heelswhile waiting for a response from the Army would provide thepeople most responsible for this nightmarish abuse a way to concealthe truth before we got the chance to tell it. It looked—and smelled—like the red herring that it was.Somewhere, I suspected, Edward R. Murrow was shaking his head insorrow and dismay.I was angry, and I let management know it. “This is CBS News,and this is what makes us CBS News,” I declared. “You asked us forpictures. We got them. You asked us for proof. We have it,” Icontinued emphatically. “There is no ‘Army version.’ ThisIS whathappened! Yes, it’s going to cause controversy. Yes, there will be hellto pay. But we should be proud of that. We are CBS News. This iswhat we do.”None of that seemed to get through. Nevertheless, Mary Mapesdutifully contacted the military once again, asking them to give ussomeone to comment on the story, which we’d tentatively scheduledfor the April 14 broadcast. The first thing they wanted to know in thePentagon Public Affairs Office was whether we had the pictures, andthey were so very sorry to hear that we did. Despite the volatilepotential of the revelations, however, Public Affairs didn’t think theycould dig up a VIP to comment in time for the April 14 airdate.Much to my consternation, Jeff Fager made the judgment call tohold the piece for another week. He insisted that we neededsomeone from the Pentagon to answer questions about Abu Ghraib,on air and on the record. I had the feeling that Fager was againfollowing a directive from above, one that came from at least theHeyward level, if not higher.If I was angry before, I was livid now. Mary says I was angrierthan she had ever heard me, or as she put it, “snarling, foot-stomping mad.” And rightly so, I believe. I was convinced that CBSwould never run the story. Mary did her best to scrape me off theceiling and started jumping through the required hoops to get acomment from the Pentagon.She and Dana also got hold of information from the Tagubareport, the official Army investigation into the abuses at Abu Ghraib.General Antonio Taguba’s findings corroborated what Chip Frederickhad told us—that MPs had been “actively requested” to “set physicaland mental conditions for favorable interrogation of witnesses.”Although that firmed up our story even further, things were now starting to get squirrelly. Our original sources were becoming restive,and rightly so. They’d stuck their necks out, and as far as they couldtell, we’d done exactly nothing with their information. What were wewaiting for? People like Bill Lawson accused us of having cold feet.How could I argue when I felt the same way? It seemed moreand more like management just wanted to get our dead rat out ofthe newsroom and bury it in an unmarked grave. I had never seenso much meddling by upper-echelon management in a particularstory. Both News Div president Andrew Heyward and senior VP BetsyWest were uncharacteristically involved in the process. To her credit,West had favored running the story as soon as she first reviewedfully what we had.Poor Jeff Fager was caught in the middle. It seemed that one sideof him was a real newsman, but the other side felt compelled to playthe corporate game. His initial instincts had been much in line withours: that we should get the story, run the story, take the heat andkeep going. That said, Jeff was very ambitious about climbing theladder in the News Division. I’m certain he was already eyeing hisnext rung, and he was aiming high. Fager hoped to take over asproducer of60 Minutes—the post Don Hewitt had held since theshow’s inception in 1968. Hewitt obviously wasn’t going to be thereforever, and Jeff saw an opportunity to put himself at the front of theline whenever the time came for Hewitt to step down. Heyward sawit the same way. (Hewitt never really liked Heyward, and the feelingwas mutual.) For that to happen, however, Jeff had to play ball withcorporate. As a result, he seemed to me to be hopelessly conflicted,almost schizophrenic. For Jeff Fager, run it or not run it, Abu Ghraibcould become a lose-lose situation.It was about this time that I got a phone call at home, one thatgave me a huge clue about why News Division executives weremicromanaging the story and dragging their feet. The caller wasRichard Myers, as in four-star general Richard Myers, chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. To me, the call from Myers was a sign thatmajor players both in Washington and within CBS were involved. Iknew him to be every inch an officer and a gentleman. He wasunusually knowledgeable and supportive of the role of the press in a democratic society. He appreciated what we did, and unlike many ofhis top brass counterparts, he was at ease around journalists. Wewere not particularly close, but occasionally, when he was in NewYork, we lunched. I liked and admired him, and still do.At the time, Myers said, our forces in Iraq were having itparticularly tough in Fallujah. The town could go either way;American lives on the front lines were hanging in the balance.Consequently, he told me, running the story would be a disservice tothe country.Over the years I have spent a lot of time with Americanservicemen and -women in areas of conflict all over the world. Ihave the utmost respect for them and would never knowingly maketheir job any harder than it already is, let alone deliberately putthem in harm’s way. I had been to Fallujah several times and knewthat fierce battles were indeed taking place there, but what Myerswas saying struck me as odd. I gave him the benefit of the doubtand believed him to be sincere. Nevertheless, it seemed to me thatwhat was happening in Fallujah had nothing whatsoever to do withthe incendiary and, frankly, un-American behavior we had uncoveredat Abu Ghraib.Myers did not ask me to flat out kill the story; he asked insteadfor a lengthy delay—three months—long enough to give thePentagon time to figure out how to deal with it. I told General Myersthe truth—that I was compassionate about the situation, but that Iwas first and foremost a journalist.As soon as I rang off, Mary and I talked about my conversationwith Myers. She did not share my opinion of the general’s honorableintentions.“You don’t think it has anything to do with troop safety?” I asked.“Just the opposite,” she said. “Dan, if you need convincing, gohave a conversation with Roger Charles. As a retired Marine officer,he believes deeply that running the story is profoundly important inkeeping our troops safe. He does not want our own troops treatedthis way—or worse—if they are captured.“The Pentagon seems to think they can keep this a secret. Theycan’t,” Mary continued. “We’ve been told by veterans and current military alike that the word about this kind of abuse always gets out.And in the case of Abu Ghraib, it’salready out. Since we’ve beenworking on this story, Roger, Dana and I have spoken with manypeople, both inside and outside the military, who know this has beengoing on. The people of Iraq know it’s been going on. The onlypeople without a clue are our American citizens at home. And theydeserve to know. They have a right to know.”Even though Myers had asked me to hold the story, he knewenough about the news business to be aware that the choice to airor not air the piece was not my call. The decision to take a story toair must first come from the executive producer, in this case the oh-so-conflicted Jeff Fager, after which it must be approved by the headof the News Division, Andrew Heyward. I suspected that Myers hadcalled Andrew Heyward before he’d called me.Perhaps not coincidentally, the Pentagon Public Affairs Office stillhadn’t come forth with anyone we could speak with for the piece.Especially after the phone call from Myers, it certainly seemedpossible if not likely that they were stalling so they could go publicwith the story themselves. Fager deferred the story once more, whileMary and Dana begged their sources to hang in there for yetanother week. They were unhappy, and they gave us an ultimatum:Run the piece or we’re taking our pictures elsewhere.In this case, “elsewhere” had a formidable name and aformidable reputation: Seymour Hersh.When I took this to Fager and Heyward, their jaws dropped—inunison. Somehow they hadn’t reckoned with the possibility thatanother journalist might eventually catch wind of our story, and ofcourse Hersh was far more than just another journalist. Sy Hersh isone of the greatest investigative reporters of our time. With Hershonto the story, our dead rat had just become radioactive.Shortly thereafter, Jeff Fager took an irate call from an apoplecticDepartment of Defense public affairs officer named Lawrence DiRita. At the top of his lungs, Di Rita angrily accused us of giving ourpictures to Sy Hersh.This was, I thought, as dimwitted as it was rash. Why would wegive away our scoop to another journalist? By April 2004, we were already well into the age of digital cameras and cell phones thatcould take pictures. There are a lot of smart people in the Pentagon.Did it not occur to anyone at DOD that other copies of the photoswere out there?As far as CBS was concerned, however, this had suddenly becomea powder keg, a calamity in the making whose implications went farbeyond the embarrassment of getting beaten to our own scoop. Notonly did Sy Hersh have our story, he also knew that we’d had thestory and that we’d been sitting on it for three weeks, in cahootswith the Pentagon. If he came out first, it would be a major blackeye for the integrity and credibility of CBS News. Worst of all, theclaim that CBS had sat on the story would, as our legendaryproducer Lane Venardos used to say, have the added advantage ofbeing true.You should have seen Andrew Heyward squirm—he understood atonce that whatever the bigwigs at the network, at corporate and inDC might have wanted, they weren’t getting it now. Spiking thepiece was off the table entirely. We had no choice but to air thestory, and to air itbefore Sy Hersh humiliated CBS News in print intheNew Yorker.Once the Army realized that it was all going to hit the fan, andthat the fan was already spinning, they arranged for me to interviewBrigadier General Mark Kimmitt, deputy director of coalitionoperations in Baghdad. Having delayed the story at the behest of thePentagon while waiting for someone in the military to comment, wefelt it was important to come clean about having done so, especiallywith Sy Hersh breathing down our necks. Kimmitt acquitted himselfquite well on camera, but he stuck closely to the official explanation,chalking up the abuse to a few bad apples.Management had been backed into running the story, but thatdidn’t mean they were happy about it. After committing to run thepiece, they made every effort to make sure nobody paid anyattention to it. They eliminated any advance on-air promotion. Thiswas highly irregular—the normal lead-up for an important story likethis was to beat the drums and get the word out. There would berounds of press interviews; we would have anchors talking about it on the morning and midday news programs; there would be promosfor the affiliates. For the Abu Ghraib story, however, it was madeclear that there was to be almost none of that.We ran it on April 28 in as watered-down a version as possible.Orders from Andrew Heyward were to run it once, period. I do notbelieve he made that decision in a vacuum. I think he was reactingto what he believed Viacom head Sumner Redstone and CBS CEOLes Moonves wanted. Whether they had expressly directed that ornot, I do not know.Although the story was obviously still unfolding, we wereforbidden by Heyward to do any significant follow-up, which isvirtually unheard-of for a story of this magnitude. If theNew YorkTimes had broken the story, there would have been follow-ups forweeks. Sy Hersh’s piece ran in the May 10 issue of theNew Yorker.(Although the cover is dated May 10, the magazine became publiclyavailable on April 30, two days after we aired.) Hersh then wrote afollow-up for each of the next two issues. Sadly, he wrote a third in2007, detailing the scapegoating of General Taguba by Rumsfeld andthe Pentagon.Bill Lawson, Mary Mapes’s original source, had talked with usbecause he was afraid that the Army was going to stick it to the littleguys and leave them with the blame. His fear has proven to be wellfounded. The only individuals found guilty on charges in connectionwith Abu Ghraib were enlisted personnel and noncoms, none abovethe rank of sergeant. Those convicted included Lawson’s nephewChip, who served three years in Leavenworth for his part in theabuse.Then as now, one must conclude that shielding the higher-upswas deliberate. When he was given the assignment to investigateabuse at Abu Ghraib, General Taguba was ordered to limit his inquiryto the MPs alone, even though he quickly realized that responsibilityfor the problem went much farther up the chain of command.“Somebody was giving them guidance, but I was legally prevented from further investigation into higher authority,” he told Sy Hersh in2007. “I was limited to a box.”In May 2004, as the scandal made headlines, the top echelons ofthe White House and the Defense Department struggled to maintain“plausible deniability.” On May 2, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairmanRichard Myers told the CBS programFace the Nation that he had notyet read General Taguba’s report. I know Myers to be a truth teller,so I cut him a lot of slack. Nevertheless, that statement defied logic.If he hadn’t already read Taguba’s report, he’d surely been told of itscontents. Otherwise, on what basis would he have asked me in Aprilto delay running the piece? Taguba had submitted his report onFebruary 26, more than two months earlier. He had ensured that itwas widely distributed; more than a dozen copies were transmittedto various recipients at the Pentagon and at CENTCOM in Florida.Even before the report was complete, however, information aboutthe photographs had been forwarded to the Pentagon, and Myersadmitted having been briefed on the problem. In sworn testimony onMay 7 before Congress, Myers said, “I’ve been receiving regularupdates since the situation developed in January, and have beeninvolved in corrective actions and personally recommended specificsteps.” He confirmed that descriptions of simulated sex acts andabuse depicted in the photos had been given “to me and theSecretary [Rumsfeld] up through the chain of command” in January,within days of the original complaint. He testified to this just fivedays after tellingFace the Nation that he had not yet read GeneralTaguba’s report. I had to admit that Mary’s skepticism about Myershad some basis. He also said, “When I spoke to Dan Rather, withwhom I already had a professional association, concerning the60Minutes story, I did so after talking to General Abizaid [then head ofCENTCOM]. And I did so out of concern for the lives of our troops.”That same day, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld alsoappeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee. “I wish wehad known more sooner and been able to tell you more sooner, butwe didn’t,” he testified. Myers, of course, had testified that Rumsfeldhad been in the loop since January. For his part, Rumsfeld seemedat least as upset that the photos had found their way to CBS as anything else. He railed against “people running around with digitalcameras and taking these unbelievable photographs and passingthem off against the law to the media, to our surprise, when theyhad not even arrived in the Pentagon.”In the same hearing, Rumsfeld also outed Sergeant JosephDarby, the man who had originally turned in the disk of photos toCID and who had been promised anonymity in return for comingforward. As Justine Sharrock reported forMother Jones, Darby wassitting in the Abu Ghraib mess hall and the TV was tuned to Senatehearings on CNN when Rumsfeld dropped his name. Darby wasrushed home; officers met his plane and whisked him and his familyinto the military equivalent of the witness protection program, wherethey remained with 24/7 security for six months. Darby says that hewas never formally thanked by the Army, but hedid get a personalletter from Rumsfeld—asking him to stop talking about how he’dbeen unveiled as the whistleblower.Perhaps not surprisingly, on May 24 Rumsfeld banned thepersonal use of cameras by the U.S. military in Iraq.Brigadier General Janis Karpinski had been relieved of commandat Abu Ghraib shortly before our piece aired. She was replaced byMajor General Geoffrey Miller. General Miller had previously beenresponsible for running military detention facilities Camp X-Ray,Camp Delta and Camp Echo at Guantánamo Bay. Before assumingcommand of Abu Ghraib, Miller had made a prior visit to the facilityin August 2003. His mission on that trip was to outline proceduresfor extracting more intel out of Iraqi detainees. In September hesubmitted a report that recommended what was later termed“Gitmo-izing” interrogation procedures at Abu Ghraib. Specificproposals included allowing military intelligence officials to havecommand over prisons and prison guards, as well as having guardsbe “actively engaged in setting the conditions for successfulexploitation of the internees.”Chip Frederick had told us in dreadful detail how that directivewas carried out. The term “enhanced interrogation” was about toenter the American lexicon. Like Myers and Rumsfeld, General Miller testified before theSenate Armed Services Committee in May 2004. (He did, however,refuse to testify at the trials of some of the enlistees charged withabuse, invoking the military equivalent of the Fifth Amendment toavoid self-incrimination.) During his Senate testimony, he indicatedthat although he’d filed a report about his visit to Abu Ghraib in2003, he had not briefed Secretary Rumsfeld or his aides about thetrip. In a statement to attorneys three months later, however, Millersaid something very different. He indicated that upon his return tothe United States from Baghdad, he had indeed given a briefing toDOD deputy secretary Paul Wolfowitz and undersecretary of defensefor intelligence Steve Cambone about his visit to the prison, togetherwith his recommendations.You’d like to think that the first prerequisite of plausibledeniability would be plausibility, but then again, 2004 was anelection year.Looking back, the only ones who really paid for Abu Ghraib werethe enlisted personnel, who were following orders, and GeneralTaguba, who brought the problem to light.Several other officers were demoted, pushed out of the militaryand/or reprimanded, but none of them did time. General RicardoSanchez, who oversaw ground troops in Iraq, was among thoseasked to resign. This struck me as curious, since he appeared tohave had little if anything to do with the actions of the OGAoperatives, or with the private contractors who bullied with impunityat Abu Ghraib. Indeed, Sanchez maintained that he and others in themilitary had argued vociferously against the use of any kind oftorture, and that those arguments fell on deaf ears at the top of thehighly political Pentagon leadership.Brigadier General Janis Karpinski had been busted down tocolonel before being forced to resign from the Army. It’s not difficultto believe that she might have been scapegoated, but officially herdisciplinary action was unrelated to Abu Ghraib. She had allegedlybeen arrested in 2002 at Florida’s MacDill Air Force Base forshoplifting cosmetics, a charge Karpinski has repeatedly denied—both the shoplifting and the arrest. In 2004, she said that she had seen a letter from Rumsfeldgreen-lighting Guantánamo-style interrogation techniques for AbuGhraib, then under her command. In 2009 she appeared on CBS’sEarly Show to talk about who paid the price for Abu Ghraib and why.“These soldiers didn’t design these techniques on their own,” shetold Harry Smith. “We were following orders. We were bringing thisto our chain of command, and they were saying whatever themilitary intelligence tells you to do out there, you are authorized todo.“The line is clear,” she continued. “It went from Washington, DC,from the very top of the administration with their legal opinions,through Bagram to Guantánamo Bay and then to Iraq via thecommander from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.” She did not name him inthat interview, but this would be Major General Geoffrey Miller.Karpinski confirmed what Bill Lawson, Chip Frederick’s uncle, hadfeared at the outset—that lower-level personnel were beingscapegoated by those in the Pentagon and in the administration. “‘Scapegoat’ is the perfect word, and it’s an understatement,” shesaid.It is a disgrace that those truly responsible for Abu Ghraib havenever been held accountable. The whole episode left a bad taste inmy mouth, not only because it was clear that people at the top gotoff scot-free, but also because of how the story had been handled atCBS. Although we did wind up breaking an all-world exclusive on animportant story, I had the uneasy sense that CBS News was nolonger CBS News as I had known it.It was troubling to me that there had been a decided absence ofexecutive backbone throughout our investigation. It was impossibleto avoid the conclusion that, but for the looming specter of SeymourHersh, the story of Abu Ghraib would never have seen the light ofday at CBS. Sy Hersh got onto it because of our reticence. One ofour sources, in frustration and fear that CBS News didn’t have thecourage to break the story, had revealed to him that we were working on it, and then gave him the proof that he needed to gowith it.The possibility that the financial and political interests of CBScorporate almost buried a story as compelling as Abu Ghraib wasmost unsettling. Little did I know that it was only going to get worsefrom there. Much worse. CHAPTER 2George Bush and the Texas Air National GuardIt was long said of me that I had the CBS Eye tattooed somewhereon my ass. And there was more than a shred of truth behind thejest. I did indeed think of myself as a team player, loyal to CBSNews, and loyal above all to its long and honorable tradition ofhonest reporting. The Bush/Guard episode confirmed the suspicion Ihad developed in the wake of the struggle to air our story on AbuGhraib—that CBS News had abandoned the principles on which itwas founded. It showed that I was loyal to something that no longerexisted, at least not at CBS.The person most responsible was Viacom owner SumnerRedstone, with his personal political bias and his need forWashington help to feed his insatiable lust for profit. Redstone’s CBScorporate headman, president and chief executive officer LesMoonves, and CBS News Division president Andrew Heyward workedto fulfill Redstone’s desires—whether those desires were directlyexpressed or not. They, I believe, at least some of the time, did soagainst what they knew to be their own better instincts andjudgment. They may have done it unhappily, but they did it. Ibelieve they did it as part of their determination to survive and moveup in the corporate world.I realize that revisiting this painful period may be seen asdangerously close to the category of “So What?” It’s old news. Whocares what an ex-president did 40 years ago?I do. For a journalist, the truth always matters, and that should bereason enough. The arrogant hypocrisy of it makes this story muchmore disturbing. A young man born of privilege whose familysecured him a spot in the National Guard to avoid military service inVietnam, and who then walked away for more than a year from eventhat safe level of obligation, eventually became the commander inchief who ordered tens of thousands of our young men and women,including those in the National Guard, into harm’s way in Iraq andAfghanistan. This same young man who gamed the system to evadegoing to Vietnam became a president who did nothing to prevent,halt or disavow the distorted character assassination of hisopponent, John Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, by his ownsupporters.There is an additional and very important reason as well: Thelegacy of what happened to our story on George Bush and his careerin the Texas Air National Guard lives on to contaminate both ourpolitics and our journalism today. There is a through-line, a long andslimy filament that connects the “murder” of Vince Foster to SwiftBoat Veterans for Truth and to the discrediting of the Killian memos.That same dirty thread stretches all the way to the selectively editedACORN “documentary” and the birther movement.The Internet has played a larger and larger role in all of theseincidents. Efforts by fringe groups to smear and discredit viainnuendo and outright falsehood generate their own counterfeitcredibility by endless online repetition, creating a digital echochamber that reverberates through the partisan grapevine untilsomeone in the legitimate media is foolish enough to pay attention.The ginned-up controversy over President Obama’s birth certificatefollowed this pattern. Birthers stated and restated their accusationsonline with a frequency bordering on obsession, if not outrightperseveration. Their charges were picked up and repeated by anti-Obama media outlets until the story became not just the birthcertificate itself, but how much attention it was getting in the press.It was the faux news story that refused to die. Even after PresidentObama released his long-form birth certificate, there remainwebsites with “irrefutable proof” that it is a forgery. These same websites continuing their assault on President Obama’s birthcertificate were in the vanguard of the efforts to invalidate ourreporting on President Bush’s disappearance from the Texas AirNational Guard. The “proof” they offer about the birth certificate isbased on typeface and proportional spacing and has a great deal incommon with their attacks on our report.Ironically enough, it’s probably fair to say that60 Minutes II wasstill on the air in September 2004 because of our story on AbuGhraib four months earlier. We’d been bounced around the schedulefrom one weekday to another; once they start messing with the timeslot, it’s a sign that the show is on the bubble. CBS president LesMoonves is first and foremost an entertainment guy. For him, newsis an also-ran, especially in prime time. It all had to do with ratings,the bottom line and his personal ambitions. In his view, having anews program in prime time took a coveted slot away from a sitcomor reality show that could generate more revenue. There already hadbeen talk of dropping60 Minutes II that spring, when the fallschedule was rolled out. It didn’t happen because News Divisionhead Andrew Heyward convinced Moonves and other networkexecutives that it would be a publicity black eye for CBS if theycanceled us so soon after reporting the Abu Ghraib story. It wouldlook too much like cause and effect. We made the cut and webecame60 Minutes Wednesday, but our position on the schedulewas tenuous.The prospect of doing a piece on George W. Bush’s highlyirregular military career was something that producer Mary Mapeshad first mentioned to me in 2000. It was always more than just astory about how a congressman’s son had leapfrogged overhundreds of other young men to land a commission in the“champagne unit” of the Texas Air National Guard and avoid servingin Vietnam. It was also a story about the mystery surrounding whatBush did and did not do while serving his country, and where andhow long he had done it. And it was a story about whether hisservice record had been selectively expunged to remove portionsthat could prove embarrassing to someone running for public office.It was a story about whether the man who wanted to and ultimately did become the commander in chief of our forces served his countryhonorably when it was his turn to stand and deliver.Other news organizations, including theBoston Globe, theWashington Post and theGuardian in the UK, had looked into itbefore Bush became president, but the story never got muchtraction anywhere else. Inexplicably, it got far less media attentionthan Al Gore’s “invention” of the Internet. I didn’t follow up then—tomy discredit—but in the middle of 2004, with George Bush runningfor reelection, serious questions about whether he had fulfilled hisservice obligations came to the forefront once more. Thesequestions were magnified by the campaign mounted by Swift BoatVeterans for Truth to impugn the service record of John Kerry, Bush’sopponent. The Swift Boaters alleged that one or more of Kerry’smedals, including three Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star and a SilverStar, were undeserved.Their assault on Kerry’s wartime heroism continued to gathersteam throughout the summer as Mary dug into Bush’s NationalGuard records. In her bookTruth and Duty, she has written acomprehensive and meticulous account of how she gatheredinformation for the segment that aired on60 Minutes Wednesday onSeptember 8, 2004. My purpose here is not to reexamine thisepisode in the degree of detail that she took many chapters toprovide. What I will do is reaffirm and reinforce the essential veracityof our reporting and describe the craven manner in which CBS pulledthe rug out from under all of us, as well as the reasoning behindtheir actions.I am very aware that reopening this old wound may be met withwide skepticism and even some snorts of derision. In what hasbecome the prevailing public view, I lost this round, big time. I havelittle expectation that I can win over those who are absolutelycertain that CBS—and specifically Mary Mapes and I—screwed uproyally. We stand accused and convicted of sloppy and irresponsiblejournalism—or worse. Many believe we deliberately broadcast astory knowing it was based on phony documents. Some allege thatwe falsified these documents ourselves. All I ask is a chance to set the record straight and to presentwhat I hope is a convincing argument that a lot of what you know,or think you know, is wrong.With that in mind, it behooves me to acknowledge that we didindeed make mistakes in reporting the story. Should we have donemore extensive vetting of the documents before we put them on theair? Yes. None of us adequately understood the implications offaxing with respect to document analysis. Ideally we should havebrought more than one analyst to New York to examine thedocuments in person. More important, what we later uncovered afterwe were already under heavy criticism would have enabled us todemonstrate beyond all doubt that the attacks on them were asham. Should we have held the segment to air at a later date?Perhaps, but we were told that was not an option. Was it an error injudgment to include the Killian memos in the piece? Knowing whatwe know now, we probably should have focused less on thedocuments themselves, more on the facts they contain and more onhow well they fit within the context of what we already knew to betrue. Do any of these issues invalidate the story itself? Absolutelynot.As Mary was looking into Bush’s military career, we talked aboutreaching out to Ben Barnes. Barnes is a colorful fellow, and I’dknown him for a long time, ever since he was an up-and-comingyoung Texas state legislator in the 1960s. He became the Lone StarState’s youngest speaker of the house at age 26. By 1969, he wasTexas’s lieutenant governor, which meant he was in position to be agatekeeper, if you will, for who got into the Texas Air National Guardand who did not. Mary started working on Ben to get him to tellwhat happened. To say that he was reluctant to tell what happenedis an understatement, but Mary is a real reporter, an indefatigablereporter—the kind you make movies about. Just as the Republicansofficially nominated George Bush in the first days of September, shecalled to tell me that Barnes had agreed to an on-camera interview.Like so many other people, Ben had found it tiresome to keep sayingno to Mary. Eventually he realized that it was easier to say yes, just to stop her from calling all the time. Nevertheless, he remainedskittish about it.As soon as coverage of the Republican convention wrapped, Iheaded to Florida. Frances, a major hurricane, was brewing off thecoast. Before I left, I called Ben Barnes to firm up his consent.Barnes was a Kerry supporter, and the swift-boating smear operationwas a burr under his saddle. He was very aware that it was hurtingKerry badly. Worse yet, it was based in Texas. “I’m not happy aboutdoing this,” he told me, “but I think it’s time.” In 1999, Barnes hadalready sworn under oath that he had recommended Bush for a spotin the Guard. That was in a deposition, however; saying so onnational television was another matter.Meanwhile, Mary continued nailing down other parts of the story.Through the Texas grapevine she had made contact with a formerlieutenant colonel in the Guard named Bill Burkett. Now a rancher inWest Texas, in February 2004, Burkett had asserted that he hadwitnessed the selective editing of Bush’s National Guard file in 1997.He was not exactly a neutral source; his dislike of Bush was wellknown. Burkett claimed to be in possession of documents thatwould, he said, blow the lid off the secrecy about Bush’s record ofservice. After some considerable cajoling, on September 2 he gaveMary two documents allegedly written by Lieutenant Colonel Jerry B.Killian, who had been Bush’s commanding officer. He wouldeventually give us four more.Although Mary was urging me to come to Texas ASAP to dointerviews, Andrew Heyward wanted me to stay in Florida withHurricane Frances. I told him what Mary said she had, and what itsimplications were. I also told him we had to be very careful with thestory, because it had thermonuclear potential. I reiterated to Andrewthat it was essential for him to stay on top of the story as itdeveloped.“You work the hurricane until it moves on,” he told me. “Then gomeet up with Mary. I’m taking charge, I’ll oversee this.” On SundayFrances began to weaken, and I drove fast and furious around fallentrees and downed power lines to get to Miami International. I barelymade the flight to Dallas. I left Florida in need of a hot shower and a decent meal. Lots of reports at the time said I looked tired. Stayingon top of a breaking news story means working odd hours, catchingquick snacks on the fly, staying up late and getting up early. Morethan anything I was short of sleep, but this kind of fatigue went withthe territory. I’d been short of sleep for much of the last 30 years.When I arrived in Texas, Mary laughed at my bedraggled appearanceand told me I looked like I had just been through a hurricane—whichwas, of course, absolutely accurate.Mary met me at the terminal and showed me the Killian memosthat Burkett had given her. She then took me through the key factsshe had confirmed:• In the waning days of May 1968, just 12 days before graduatingfrom Yale, at which time his student deferment would have expired,George W. Bush applied to become a pilot trainee in the Texas AirNational Guard. Ben Barnes had received a phone call from Bushfamily friend Sidney Adger and had subsequently put in a call toBrigadier General James Rose, Commander of the Texas Air NationalGuard. With the influence of his father, George H. W. Bush, then acongressman, Bush was accepted into the Guard’s champagne unit.• Despite Bush’s lack of any aviation or ROTC experience, anddespite his bare minimum scores on the pilot aptitude tests, GeneralRose immediately put him into flight school. He then made Bush asecond lieutenant after only six weeks of basic training.• Beginning in 1970, Bush’s initial performance as an F-102 pilotwas commendable—and well documented. Starting early in 1972,however, there were problems. Flight logs show that on twoseparate occasions, he needed more than two passes to land his F-102, even though by this time he had logged more than 200 hoursin that aircraft. He stopped flying the F-102 and resumed flying a T-33 training jet, the same aircraft from which he’d graduated a fewyears before. He then was assigned to put in additional time in aflight simulator.• In April 1972, he stopped flying altogether. At that point he stillhad two full years remaining on his obligation to serve as a pilot. • On May 15, 1972, Bush left Ellington Air Force Base and the147th Fighter Interceptor Group in Houston and went to Alabamawith Jimmy and Linda Allison to work on Winton Blount’s senatorialcampaign. Jimmy Allison owned the newspaper in Midland, Texas,and at the time was a close confidante of George H. W. Bush.• Mary had just spoken with Linda Allison. Although she declinedto be interviewed on camera, she said that she and her husbandJimmy (since deceased) had been asked by Bush’s father to takeyoung George to Alabama because he was “getting in trouble andembarrassing the family.” After about a month, she had asked Jimmywhat exactly Bush was doing for the Blount campaign, since shenever saw him do anything. And in all the time he was there, shenever saw him in uniform.• After leaving Ellington for Alabama, as far as the Guard wasconcerned, George Bush pretty much went off the grid for a year. Inan annual evaluation, Bush’s two immediate superiors stated thatBush “had not been observed” in Texas during the period of report,beginning May 1972 and ending in April 1973.• He was not observed in Alabama, either. On September 15,1972, Bush was ordered to report for training with the 187th TacticalRecon Group at Dannelly Field in Montgomery, Alabama. Neither hiscommanding officers nor any fellow Guardsmen remembered seeinghim there. In February 2004, theWashington Post had tried andfailed to find anyone in the 187th who remembered seeing him.Eventually John “Bill” Calhoun, a former Guardsman, came forwardand vouched for having seen Lieutenant Bush at Dannelly abouteight or ten times between May and October 1972. This gave him aninstant credibility problem, since Bush was not supposed to report toDannelly until September.• In 1972, Bush failed to take the physical exam required of allGuard pilots, a serious violation. The question of his failure to do sohad come up several times during Bush’s political career, and overthe years Bush spokesmen had offered various mutually exclusiveexplanations for it. One explanation had been that Bush’s family doctor was unavailable, but physical exams for all pilots must begiven by Air Force flight surgeons (who were available to Bush bothin Texas and in Alabama). A second explanation was that the F-102had been decommissioned; that did not occur, however, until 1974.Most recently, in February 2004, Bush’s spokesman Dan Bartlett saidthat Bush didn’t take the physical because he saw no reason to doso, since his unit at Dannelly didn’t fly the same aircraft.• In the wake of his failure to take a physical, a flight inquiryboard should have been convened. There is no record that such areview board ever met.• On September 29, Bush was officially grounded by MajorGeneral Francis Greenlief, chief of the National Guard Bureau, forfailing to take his physical. Bush was ordered to acknowledge inwriting that he’d been grounded. There is no such acknowledgment.• On June 29, 1973, Bush’s commanding officers in Houston wereordered to get additional information from the 187th in Alabama, sothat Bush could be evaluated.• Bush was honorably discharged in October 1973, eight monthsbefore his term officially was to expire.These facts were just the top of a very large pile. Mary kept athick notebook of all the documents, interviews and contacts shehad amassed. There was more than enough research to raiseimportant questions about Bush’s National Guard servicewithout thedocuments from Burkett. Our main challenge was to be selectiveabout what to put on the air. With the seeming support of ourexecutive and senior producers, we came to believe that the Killianmemos would be a good addition to a story that needed more thantalking heads. They also jibed with what we could already prove.They were new news, assuming we could confirm that they weregenuine, but going to the author was not possible, since Killian hadpassed away in 1984.What new information did these documents contain? A memodated May 4, 1972, directed Bush to take his physical examination no later than May 14. That deadline was just one day before he“cleared this base [Ellington],” in the words of another superiorofficer, and left for Alabama. Another memo, dated August 1, 1972,said that Bush was being suspended because he had made “noattempt to meet his training certification or flight physical” and for“failure to perform to USAF/TexANG standards.” Since documentsshowed he’d been officially grounded shortly thereafter, the timingfit. In a third memo, dated August 18, 1973, Killian indicated thatLieutenant Bush had not been in Texas during the rating period, thathe was unable to get any information out of the 187th in Alabama,and that he was being pressured to “sugar coat” the problem. Thememo bore the subject heading “CYA,” and it was written by Killianfor his own personal files as a way of protecting himself. Since wealready knew that on June 29 Killian had been ordered to getadditional information from Alabama, where Bush was to have beenon duty, the timing fit in this instance as well.The memos we received from Burkett underscored what wealready had, but they were far from the only proof we had that Bushhad gone missing for a year and had played fast and loose with hismilitary obligations. Nevertheless, I knew that we needed to getsomeone reliable to vouch for the memos, in fact, multiplesomeones, if we were to use them on air. I asked Mary to get fourindependent experts to verify that they were genuine, but she wasalready on it. Mary had faxed the documents to New York and hadasked Yvonne Miller, an associate producer, to start lining up expertsto examine them.Mary and I flew to Austin so I could interview Robert Strong, whohad been in the Texas Air National Guard and who had known JerryKillian. We showed him the documents. He felt very strongly thatthey were a good representation of Lieutenant Colonel Killian’sattitude about military obligations. He also said that they reflectedthe opinions Killian had voiced to him about the part-time andprivileged National Guard members he oversaw in his unit.When the interview was over, we flew back to New York. I caughtjust a couple hours’ sleep before coming in to anchor special-eventscoverage on President Clinton’s heart bypass surgery. Mary logged about the same number of hours of sleep before going into theoffice, which on Labor Day was all but empty.Josh Howard and Andrew Heyward were not present, eventhough Andrew had previously assured me that he would bepersonally involved, as he had been with Abu Ghraib. Josh was ournew executive producer, and I would have liked to see Andrewlooking over his shoulder, since this was Josh’s first executiveproducer position. (Jeff Fager had ascended to the next rung andhad been anointed as Don Hewitt’s successor at60 Minutes Sunday.)As it was, neither Andrew nor Josh nor VP Betsy West was there atthis crucial time. Despite the holiday, on a story with this muchsensitivity and this much explosive potential, leadership in the NewsDivision should have been in the office shepherding the story,debating approaches and helping with content decisions. In the daysof Richard Salant and Fred Friendly, they would have been. I believethat if Andrew Heyward had done his job, if Betsy West had doneher job, they would have made sure Mary had more help, but shewas just swamped.Yvonne Miller had sent the faxed copies of the Killian memos we’dreceived from Burkett to three independent document analysts:Marcel Matley, James Pierce and Emily Will, together with Killiansignatures from Bush’s official records. Mary had already handed offanother set to a fourth analyst, Linda James. James indicated thatshe wanted to examine the originals before rendering an opinion.Emily Will had a problem from the outset. She doubted that theywere genuine, she said, because according to official records Bushhad been in Alabama at the time these memos were written—which,of course, was exactly the point. Jim Pierce had worked with the LosAngeles Police Department and had done document analysis for theFBI. He was unequivocal in his assessment that the memos we hadreceived from Burkett were consistent with other official records inKillian’s hand.We flew Marcel Matley to New York to see the documentsfirsthand. Matley was considered something of a wise man in thefield of document analysis. He had written a number of books on thesubject and was regularly called to testify in court as an expert witness. We talked with him a great deal about the science and artof handwriting and document analysis. We knew that it was oftenused in court; we also knew that there were limitations on what theanalysis could and could not confirm. Matley spent a great deal oftime examining the signatures as well as the typeface. He looked forall kinds of specifics, what he called “consistent inconsistencies” and“inconsistent consistencies.” Matley saw absolutely no reason tobelieve that what we had was not legitimate in terms of typeface,structure of the document and analysis of the signatures incomparison with other official documents already in our possession.On Tuesday, September 7, Ben Barnes came in for his interview.With the cameras rolling, he said that he’d helped George Bush getinto the Texas Air National Guard and that he’d done the same forother sons of privilege. He also talked about the personal remorsehe felt at what he’d done and his realization over the years that whathe’d done was wrong.That same day, we came together to discuss the piece—Mary,Betsy West, Josh Howard, Andrew Heyward and me. We talkedspecifically about how the memos had been examined; everyoneseemed satisfied that we had done due diligence in that regard.It was time to ask the White House to comment. I was slated togo to Washington early on Wednesday morning, the day of thebroadcast, to interview Dan Bartlett, White House communicationsdirector. The weather, however, looked bad for getting out of NewYork, and there was a chance that even if I got to DC, I wouldn’t beable to get back. John Roberts, a CBS correspondent and a goodfriend of mine, did the Bartlett interview instead.I was aware that Bartlett, along with Karen Hughes, had longbeen suspected in political circles as the pair who had allegedlysanitized Bush’s National Guard record back in the late 1990s. Fromthe beginning of Bush’s political career, there had been a buzz inTexas about problems with Bush’s record of service in the Guard.Bartlett and Hughes were consistently the point people authorized todiscuss it with the media. Over time, the buzz got louder as to howBartlett had “made his bones” by making the issue go away. It wasBartlett who had delivered several of the conflicting explanations for why Bush had not taken his physical, despite being ordered to do so.Nevertheless, if we were going to get a response from the WhiteHouse, it had to come through him.During the interview with Roberts, Bartlett glossed over questionsabout Bush’s record while in the Guard and returned over and overto the idea that all this was old news, and to the fact that Bush hadbeen honorably discharged. We had already faxed copies of ourdocuments to the White House so they could have a look at them. Atour request, Bartlett also showed them to President Bush and askedhim to comment. His reply: “I have no recollection of any of this.”Both Josh Howard and Andrew Heyward were ecstatic when theylearned what the White House response had been, because it meantthat they had denied nothing whatsoever.As was the case with Abu Ghraib, the decision to air the segmenton Bush and the Texas Air National Guard rested in the hands of theexecutives of the News Division. There has been a lot of hindsightdiscussion and second-guessing about why we did not defer thepiece to a later airdate. That was not our decision to make, and wewere told it was not possible. Because60 Minutes II was to bepreempted twice in various parts of the country over the next fewweeks (once for Billy Graham and a second time for Dr. Phil), wewould have had to hold it till October, and management deemed thattoo late to run it.Josh Howard, our executive producer, said we had two choices:run the story on the 8th, or forget the story. Now or never. We evenasked whether it could run on the Sunday60 Minutes and wereturned down. It was a matter of politics—internal CBS politics. SinceI wasn’t a regular correspondent on the Sunday show, they didn’twant a segment of mine airing there. We had to make the piecework for the September 8 airdate.Before any segment is broadcast, there is a final screening.Typically there is at least one lawyer from the CBS Corporate GeneralCounsel’s Office in attendance. This one had two. The screening washeld at 3:30 in the afternoon; Betsy West, Mary Mapes and JoshHoward were there. Andrew Heyward got a private screening, afterthe others. I only know any of this secondhand, because I was not at the screening. In all my time at CBS, the correspondent hadalways had a chance to see his or her piece before it aired. Not onlywas I absent, I was not even notified that the screening washappening. I found out through a chance encounter with a tapeeditor as I was crossing 57th Street.At that point I was crisscrossing 57th Street a lot, because I wasshuttling back and forth between doing on-camera work and voice-overs for60 Minutes II and getting ready for theEvening News.There was a full-on frenzy of writing, editing and rewriting to get theBush/Guard segment ready to air. Finally we were good to go, butonlyafter Executive Producer Josh Howard, Vice President BetsyWest, News Division president Andrew Heyward and the lawyersfrom corporateall signed off on the story. When I finally got achance to speak with Josh, he neglected to mention that twoportions of the segment had been edited down or out—probably atAndrew Heyward’s direction. These were interviews that I thoughtwere crucial to the story. With the benefit of hindsight, I believe thatthe key reason I was uninvited from the screening was that theyknew I would object strongly to removing them.One was the interview with handwriting analyst Marcel Matley,which was not eliminated outright but was much truncated. It wasthe only on-camera interview we had with an expert explaining whyhe was confident that Killian’s signature was genuine, and he wasthe only document analyst who’d seen anything other than a faxedcopy. In my opinion, the executives found him boring. In their view,his detailed explanations about why he believed in the documentsslowed the story down.The other was a conversation with David Hackworth, the highlydecorated retired Army colonel who ran the website called Soldiersfor the Truth. At this point, David Hackworth had less than a year tolive. He was terminally ill with bladder cancer, a disease that mayhave resulted from his exposure to chemical defoliants in Vietnam.At our request, Hackworth reviewed everything we had procuredfrom Bush’s official records. He was especially taken aback by theyearlong gap in documentation. With the exception of seeing adentist at Dannelly in Alabama in January 1973, there was no official record of Bush’s having done anything with the Guard between May1972 and May 1973.Despite being debilitated by chemotherapy, Hackworth wanted togo on the record; for him, Bush’s dereliction of duty was personal.Soldiers who had risked their lives in Vietnam had long known aboutBush, he told me. “What we know,” he said, “is that when hiscountry needed him, our president walked away.” On behalf of thegrunts he had served with in Vietnam, as well as the grunts in Iraqand Afghanistan for whom he worked diligently to procure betterlifesaving body armor, he deeply resented what Bush had done.Hackworth had absolutely no doubt that Bush had gone AWOL, orworse. AWOL is defined as absence for 30 days or less, but Bush’sabsence had been far more lengthy. The question for Hackworth waswhether George Bush had deserted. Desertion is defined as absencewith a determined intent not to return. “Let me put it this way,” hesaid. “I don’t care if you’re a buck private or a five-star general,nobody just disappears. No institution generates paperwork like themilitary. All duty is observed and evaluated. If he’d been doing drills,there would be a record. I think he deserted.”I didn’t know about removals of the Hackworth and Matleyinterviews until after the show had already aired. At first I wasincredulous: we had a hero, one of our country’s most decoratedsenior officers, saying on camera that he thought his commander inchief was at least AWOL and probably a deserter—and that had beenedited out? We had backed away from something as powerful asthat? Josh Howard told Mary he thought Hackworth had come ontoo strong.He pruned other portions of the script as well, cutting outsections that demonstrated how well the new information fit withinthe context of what we already knew. He also ordered the removalof a portion of the script referring to a statement by General BobbyHodges, Killian’s immediate commanding officer, saying that theKillian memos were consistent with what he’d heard Killian say aboutLieutenant Bush at the time. Perhaps Josh didn’t realize it, but withthese deletions he eviscerated major underpinnings supporting theintegrity of the piece. By the way it was edited, the impression left with the viewer was that everything we said rested on the Killianmemos, not on the huge body of additional documentation we hadamassed. I went from incredulous to angry when I realized that ithad been deliberately done behind my back.Soon enough, however, my anger no longer mattered. Shortlyafter the broadcast, someone called to tell me we were catching alot of flack on the Internet. With a piece like that, I thought it was tobe expected, but what was different in this case was the intensity ofthe vilification. Bloggers on ultraconservative websites with nameslike Free Republic, Little Green Footballs, and Power Line werevociferously attacking our report, even before it finished airing, andthey were focusing in particular on the Killian documents. Thewebsites trumpeted their certainty that the Killian memos werecounterfeit—and alleged that we had forged them ourselves.One particularly detailed analysis was posted on Free Republic bya blogger calling himself Buckhead. With an apparently encyclopedicknowledge of the history of typography and of typeface minutia,Buckhead zeroed in on what he declared were obvious telltaleinconsistencies in the Killian memos—the font was wrong;proportional spacing didn’t exist yet; typewriters couldn’t producethe superscript “th” back then. “I am saying these documents areforgeries run through a copier for 15 generations to make them lookold,” he wrote. “This should be pursued aggressively.”Buckhead had rendered his judgment about four hours after thebroadcast ended. Moreover, what he ostensibly had scrutinized wasa fleeting image on a television screen. Without actually having seenthe documents themselves, Buckhead pronounced the memos to bephony. Other instant experts on other right-wing websites chimed insoon thereafter. To authenticate their accusations, they cited oneanother, and the reverberating noise in cyberspace picked updecibels with each bounce off the wall.Although it is commonplace today, it bears mentioning that inSeptember 2004, using the Internet as a political tool was in itsinfancy. We didn’t realize it at the time, but what we were seeingwas the beginning of a well-orchestrated Internet campaign, whathas since become known as a blogswarm. And we were in the crosshairs. At the time, CBS News had no Internet presence of itsown and was not accustomed to the new rules of engagement incyberspace. The Internet attacks on our report snowballedovernight, so much so that by Thursday morning Josh Howard wascompletely unnerved.He was not alone. Everyone at CBS was blindsided by what washappening. We had never been attacked this way before. CBS hadno crisis management staff, no playbook for how to respond. Wewere overwhelmed.The attacks didn’t stop with the Internet, however. We wereinundated with irate phone calls and deluged with vitriolic faxes. Itwas a tsunami of outrage. The fax machine right outside Mary’soffice was running constantly, spewing out hate mail, page afterpage after page. Fake! Fake! Fake! they screamed. And that was thebest of it. Many were obscene. Some were threatening.I was as astounded as I was outraged. “Mary—what the hell isgoing on here?” I asked as I watched the machine spitting venom asfast as it could.“It’s been doing that all day long,” she said.“There’s a general fax line for CBS News, but this particular line isunlisted,” I said. “How did anyone get the number?”“One of the last times I used it was to send the Killian documentsto the White House,” she said. “Before the interview with Bartlett.Doesn’t the outgoing fax number show up as a header on eachpage?”Not surprisingly, the same allegations that were appearing on theInternet soon sprang up in right-wing media outlets. CreativeResponse Concepts, a conservative PR firm, sent out a mediaadvisory on Thursday the 9th reading, “60 Minutes Documents onBush Might Be Fake.” CRC was headed by Greg Mueller, formercommunications director for Pat Buchanan, and by Mike Russell,former communications director for Pat Robertson. CRC clientsincluded the Republican National Committee, as well as the NationalRepublican Congressional and Senatorial committees. At the time,Mike Russell was also the media spokesman for Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. Their version of the story quickly aired on AM talk radioand, of course, Fox News.By this time I had been employed by CBS for more than 40 years.During those four decades, the network had come under intensecriticism on numerous occasions—for our civil rights reporting, forThe Selling of the Pentagon, and for our Watergate coverage, toname just a few. I knew nothing about how to deal with an Internet-based attack—none of us did—but I did know how CBS News hadalways responded to assaults from the outside. During those crises,the News Division had instinctively closed ranks to present a unifiedfront, both to the adversary and to the public. Richard Salant, whohad been president of CBS News during many of these attacks, put itsuccinctly in his memoirs: “The people in CBS News were, in theirway, a tight and prickly extended family, which circled the wagons atany signal that News was, in its view, being threatened.” In responseto these new attacks from outside, I tried to keep that faith andcircle my wagon, only to find out that there weren’t any other CBSwagons circling with me.I knew that the first 48 to 72 hours were critical, and that we hadto hold ourselves together. If we believed in the story, and Iunequivocally did, it was essential to fight the accusers ferociously,hand to hand in every trench. I was soon contacted by Gil Schwartz,CBS’s corporate VP in charge of communications. It appeared at firstblush that Gil’s job was to craft that vigorous defense of our story,but I later concluded Gil’s assignment was to keep CBS’s Big Wagon—Leslie Moonves—as far removed from the circle as possible.Shortly thereafter, someone in Gil’s office asked me whether Iwould be willing to speak with a reporter from theWashington Post.I was happy to oblige. The interviewer asked what we had done tocheck out our sources on the story. I explained at some length, butthen was amazed and disappointed when I saw that very little ofwhat I’d said appeared in thePost the next morning. Instead, thestory that ran on Friday, September 10th, took us apart. The piecereiterated everything the original attackers had claimed to be bogusabout the Killian memos: The font was wrong; proportional spacingdidn’t exist yet; typewriters couldn’t produce the superscript “th” back then… In short, thePost took at face value the allegationsmade by Buckhead and others in the blogswarm and then echoedthem pretty much verbatim.By rehashing the right wing’s unsubstantiated allegations, thearticle in thePost stoked the fire of the controversy and validatedthe accusations made by the bloggers. This struck me as anythingbut objective journalism. It seemed to me to be downrightincendiary. The piece in thePost detonated a series of virulent anti-CBS, anti-Rather, and anti-Mapes explosions coming not just fromright-wing websites, but from legitimate media outlets as well.The typeface smokescreen laid down by the bloggers paid off bigtime. By implication, they charged, because of the questions raisedabout the documents, everything else in the broadcast had to befalse as well. In my estimation, thePost has a great deal to answerfor. For the rest of the mainstream media, thePost story legitimizedthe blogosphere’s accusations that the Killian memos werefraudulent.From that point on, there was blood in the water—mine, Mary’sand the News Division’s. The long knives were out, and we weretargets for every other news organization in the country. Ordinarily,with a story of this nature the rest of the press digs further into thestory. Instead, they dug into us.The ruckus over the Killian memos effectively diverted any and allfurther journalistic inquiry into Bush’s activities; in close-up magic,they call it misdirection. While every other news outlet waspreoccupied by the bloggers’ sleight of hand about superscripts andproportional spacing, no other reporters picked up on the legitimatequestion of whether Lieutenant Bush had actually fulfilled his militaryobligations.• No one tried to find an explanation for why he’d been bouncedback into a T-33 training aircraft in spring of 1972, or why it hadtaken him two passes on two different occasions to land his F-102.• No one asked President Bush to explain why he had refused adirect order to take the physical he was required to take to keepflying. • No one asked whether his refusal had anything to do with thefact that the Department of Defense instituted random drug testingin April 1972.• No one asked how he was able to just walk away from hisaircraft and stop flying—after American taxpayers had investedupward of a million dollars in his training.• No one looked into his missing year from mid-1972 to mid-1973, or the fact that he never reported to any Guard unit inBoston/Cambridge as he was obligated to do once he begangraduate school, or how he got discharged early.All further reportage about the story was solely about the Killianmemos. The story, and the extreme reaction to it, had intimidatednot just CBS, but the rest of the press as well. It was a journalisticmeltdown of the first magnitude.ThePost story also meant that every phone in the News Divisionwas ringing off the hook on Friday morning. Someone had torespond, and corporate believed that someone was me. What Iheard time and time again was, “Dan, you care about the institution.You care about the legacy of Edward R. Murrow. You are the brand,the ‘face’ of CBS News, and you are the correspondent on this story.We want you to speak to every print organization that’s made arequest. We want you to speak to every radio organization. We wantyou all over TV. We need you to go balls out on our response onthis.”Because I absolutely believed in the story, and because of that40-year-old tattoo on my ass, I did. I spent an entire day at CBSNews talking to other journalists. I assured one and all that we atCBS stood by our reporting—and by our reporters. I was so busydefending the story, my team and the network that I never noticedthat I was circling my wagon all by myself. The leadership of theNews Division had completely disappeared. Particularly conspicuousby his absence in the defense of our story was our president, Andrew Heyward, the man whose final approval had put the pieceon the air.With the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear to me that this wasthe beginning of the cocooning process by which the higher-upshermetically sealed themselves off from the problem. It wasparticularly important to Leslie Moonves that he remain above thefray. Just over three months earlier, Viacom chair Sumner Redstonehad named Moonves, CEO of CBS, and Tom Freston, CEO of MTV, asco-presidents and co–chief operating officers as part of what wasbilled as a Viacom corporate succession plan. Freston was aseasygoing as Moonves was intense; small wonder they got alongabout as well as two tomcats in a gunnysack.Which was exactly where Redstone had put them. Deliberately.Redstone, then 81 years old, had yoked them together in a high-level rivalry—in every way a clash of the titans—to determine whowould succeed him. Presumably, if Moonves was to get entangled inthis Bush controversy, it would have jeopardized his chances ofinheriting Redstone’s mantle, provided Redstone ever let go of it.Meanwhile, we started playing defense. Mary worked till she wastruly cross-eyed to prove that every factoid that had been singledout by Buckhead and other bloggers, everything that had beenparroted by thePost, was either untrue or unproven. In saying wewere wrong, they were wrong on every count. Yes, youcould makea superscript “th” on a typewriter back then. There were examplesall over the newsroom. No, that font was most assuredlynotcomputer-generated Times New Roman.She did this virtually alone, because Mary had quickly become theoffice leper. Not only was she being demonized by outsiders, bothonline and in the mainstream press, she was taking a lot of heatinternally as well. The chorus of boos within CBS was led by the60Minutes Sunday contingent, which had its envies and jealousies ofher going back to her story on Abu Ghraib, and to her story on EssieMae Washington-Williams, Strom Thurmond’s biracial daughter,before that.By Sunday the 12th, I started to get all kinds of unsubtle hintsthat I should let Mary take the fall for what had happened. The pressure was coming from friend and foe alike. I found it necessaryto reiterate that the tradition of CBS News had always beensolidarity. We hold ourselves together while we’re in the vortex, andwe come out the other end together, just like any other fight you getinto. You have to steel your will. Some well-meaning individuals evencalled my longtime friend and agent, Richard Leibner, asking him tointercede. They wanted him to put the bug in my ear to throw Maryoverboard. Without apology then or now, my answer was,“Absolutely not. If you think I’m going to cut Mary loose orscapegoat her, you don’t know me very well. Mary is a great reporterin the very best tradition of CBS News, a great producer, and not inmy presence am I going to hear any talk of blaming her or cuttingher loose. And by the way, if you think tossing Mary to the dogs isgoing to do anything other than increase their appetite, then youdon’t know much about how these things work.”Following the broadcast, the analysts came under almost as muchscrutiny as the memos themselves. The issue was whether theycould “authenticate” the documents. For a layman, “authenticate”means being able to verify that a given object is genuine. For anexpert witness accustomed to testifying in court, however, the term“authenticate” has a precise and far more rigorous legal definition.For a document analyst, it denotes 100 percent certainty, based onbeing able to prove where and when the paper originated, what kindof ink was used, etc. Because Burkett had given us photocopies, ourexperts knew that they would not be able to fully “authenticate” thedocuments in this very specific legal sense of the word. We at CBSunderstood it as well.In the blaze that arced the gap from the right-wing blogosphereto the mainstream media, however, we were all excoriated for this“failure to authenticate.” Those who criticized us the most fiercelywere, of course, using the word “authenticate” in the informal,everyday sense of the word—as if we had neglected to do anychecking whatsoever. Lost in the ensuing firestorm was the fact thatJames Pierce never wavered in his opinion that the signatures wereKillian’s. Marcel Matley continued to reiterate his assessment that thetypeface was consistent with what was available in the early 1970s and that all of the signatures, both in Bush’s official records and inthe Killian memos we received from Burkett, appeared to be by thesame hand. And he stands by that analysis to this day.Emily Will and Linda James, however, backpedaled furiously andinsisted they had warned that the documents could be fake. PerhapsEmily Will should have revealed that she was not exactlynonpartisan. Her initial inclination to take Bush’s records at facevalue and presume he was in Alabama when he said he was shouldhave been a clue. Later records show that Emily Will is a RepublicanParty financial supporter. From an ethical standpoint, I believe thatthis was an assignment she should have declined.Other typeface experts soon came out of the woodwork, includingseveral who claimed they could produce exact replicas on theircomputers. It was not until months later that Dr. David Hailey,associate professor of Professional and Technical Communication atUtah State University, confirmed and bolstered our initial findingswith extensive and rigorous scientific analysis. After blowing up thedocuments to many times their original size—in his words, literally tothe size of sofa cushions—he examined them in close detail. Heprepared a 170-page report and summarized his finding as follows:“There can no longer be a question whether the memos were typed—they were typed.”Hailey found that what others had seen as proportional spacingwas in fact fractions of carriage returns. He also looked at inkplacement and saw idiosyncrasies and differences in wear onindividual letters—especially on the “e” and “t,” the most commonlyused letters—something that is not possible on a computer. Throughmagnification, he discovered “signature interaction” between the penstroke of the Killian signature and the typing—the pen sliding in andout of the vertical lines of typed capital letters, something onlypossible if there were impressions on the page from typingbeforethe signature was made. He also identified characters in thedocuments that were not consistent with the Times New Romantypestyle. The Bush-supporting bloggers had relied on the falseconclusion that the Killian documents were in Times New Roman, atypestyle not in existence during the Vietnam War. If a document is typed in a particular typestyle,all the characters have to match, andseveral of the characters in the Killian memos do not match TimesNew Roman.In the days immediately following the broadcast, however, thisammunition was not available to us. As the controversymushroomed, the Hard Right rallied Bush supporters to counter ourversion of events, and often to contradict themselves. General BobbyHodges, who had initially corroborated the story to us in detail, nowtold ABC that we’d misled him and that he, too, thought thedocuments had been forged. Killian’s son Gary assured the pressthat his late father would never have kept a CYA file, this despitehaving told us before the segment aired that he knew very littleabout his father’s career in the National Guard.On September 15, Mary accompanied 86-year-old Marian CarrKnox, who had been Killian’s secretary, from Texas to New York to beinterviewed about the memos. Neither Mary nor anyone on our teamhad found Mrs. Knox. The Associated Press had found her after ourprogram aired. If we’d found her beforehand, we would have usedher. “I know that I didn’t type them,” she told us. “However, theinformation in those is correct.” She said that what was in themsquared with what Killian thought of Lieutenant Bush. Killian and theother officers would “snicker about what [Bush] was getting awaywith.” She clearly remembered the colonel being angry at Bush’srefusal of a direct order to take his flight physical, and at his attitudeof entitlement. She also acknowledged that Killian had started whatshe called a “cover-your-back” file dealing with problems such asthese. That was the positive; the negative was that she said she hadnot typed the memos. What emerged in the press thereafter wasonly about the negative. There was nothing about Bush refusing adirect order and everything about Mrs. Knox saying that she didn’ttype them, so therefore, it was concluded, the memos weren’tgenuine.At Andrew Heyward’s direction, Mary set up a conference call withBill Burkett. One huge question was how the memos had found theirway to him. He had previously given us the name of George Conn asthe source, but as Andrew began to question him more intently, he changed his story completely and now said that Conn had nothing todo with it. Betsy West, Mary, Heyward and I were all astonishedwhen he said that a woman named Lucy Ramirez, whom he’d nevermentioned before, had had a dark-skinned man deliver the papers tohim at the Houston Livestock Show.This came entirely out of the blue, and it was dreadful news.What Burkett probably did not realize was that when a source liesabout anything, he completely loses all credibility. He handed potentnew ammunition to those who were already screaming that thedocuments were false. He also handed Andrew Heyward a get-out-of-jail-free card for distancing himself and everyone above him fromthe crisis. After the call ended, Heyward directed Mary to get him oncamera.Shortly thereafter, Andrew Heyward ordered Mary to stop workingon the story, even by phone, even from her own home.Professionally, she was placed under house arrest. Then CBS forbadeanyone from working on the story in any way, shape or form,including me. In effect, we were ordered to surrender, and for thelife of me I couldn’t understand why.I went to Heyward to complain. “This is madness,” I told him.“We are under unrelenting attack on a story that you and I bothknow is true.”“That’s not the point, Dan.”I tried to hide my amazement—unsuccessfully, I suspect. Thepresident of CBS News was telling me directly that defending thetruth didn’t matter. “Why not?”“Because the documents have been made the focal point.”“Andrew, anyone who has studied combat knows that you don’tlet the enemy choose the ground where the decisive battle is to befought.”It didn’t register. I might as well have been speaking Martian.“Dan, you don’t understand. No more,” he said flatly.“Andrew, that’s unacceptable.”And with that, I went back to my desk. I thought about it brieflyand then headed back to his office. “Andrew, you’ve completely shutdown CBS News from investigating this any further. To me that’s just wrong. We can’t just throw up our hands and surrender, above all ona story that we know to be true. I feel so strongly about this that I’mgoing to hire an investigator on my own, with money from my ownpocket.”Andrew tried to keep a poker face, but his eyes registered alarm.I really knew I’d gotten his attention because he insisted there mustsurely be a clause in my contract that would prevent me from doingthat. I had just lined up a former NYC homicide detective to beginmy investigation when Heyward came back to me with a differentproposal. CBS, he said, was going to hire its own outsideinvestigative team. At first he indicated they were looking at KrollInc., a large and prestigious New York–based investigative firm, buthe backed away from that quickly, saying that Kroll had wanted toomuch money. The company they turned to instead was SafirRosetti,a security firm that was run by Howard Safir.I immediately expressed my skepticism. Even if they werecompetent, this hardly sounded to me like a disinterested outfit:Howard Safir had been Rudy Giuliani’s police commissioner. Safir’sfirm jobbed out the assignment to a former FBI investigator namedErik Rigler. Word came back pretty quickly that Rigler had run upagainst stone walls everywhere. He never got any farther than BillBurkett.On September 18, a reporter for theLos Angeles Times, PeterWallsten, broke what should have been a major development whenhe outed Buckhead as Harry MacDougald, an Atlanta attorney. In thewake of the Monica Lewinsky affair, Harry MacDougald had helpeddraft the motion to the Arkansas Supreme Court asking that formerpresident Clinton be disbarred in his home state. But even thisstartling revelation—that Buckhead was not a typography expert buta conservative activist with strong ties to the Republican Party—didnothing to derail the “phony documents” juggernaut.By this time, the story had taken on a life of its own. Instead ofbroadcasting the news, we had become the news, which is everyjournalist’s worst nightmare.The night before I was to interview Burkett, Andrew Heywardconvened a meeting without my knowledge with some of his top staff and a few other colleagues in the New York broadcast center. Aperson who was in the room revealed to me several years later thatHeyward told those in attendance that under no circumstances was Ito learn what was discussed, or even that there had been a meetingat all.The purpose of the clandestine gathering was to strategize andplan for the Burkett interview. I had been ordered to conduct theinterview, but the purpose was not disclosed to me. I had beeninformed that the intention was to give Burkett a chance to explainhimself and to give his side of the story. I was also told that it wouldbe put on the air “at some length,” but that was not the real agenda.On September 18, I flew to Dallas to meet up with Mary and dothe interview with Burkett. Betsy West was assigned to come withme, bringing a specific list of questions I was to ask. She didn’t tellme at the time, but the list had come from Andrew Heyward. EarlierI had asked Heyward to go with me for the interview. He hadrefused. He was heavily into his distancing mode, but I wasn’t smartenough to see it then. I still trusted him. As I later learned, he hadgiven Betsy the job of making sure I got what management neededout of Burkett, which was for him to say that he had lied about thechain of custody of the documents, and to say it on camera. That’sall they wanted out of him. I came to realize that it was never theirintention to broadcast “at some length.” Midway through, Betsy gaveme a few extra questions. I knew these had come from Heyward aswell, because she had just gotten off the phone with him. Thequestions turned the interview into a grueling interrogation, forcingBurkett to state over and over that he’d lied. The interview lastedthe better part of three hours.After finishing with Burkett, I went to see my daughter andgrandson. While there, I was told to report to Andrew Heyward’soffice at 8:00 p.m. Sunday night. This was a first, the only time anyCBS News president had ever given me a direct order. I was dueback in New York at 9:00 a.m. the following morning, but I was toldthat was not soon enough. I flew back to New York for my commandperformance. As I recall, when I arrived, Heyward told me that CBS was goingto apologize for the documents and that they expected me toapologize personally as well.“Are you going to retract the story?” I asked.“No, but we’re going to apologize.”“Well, what exactly are we apologizing about?”It was a gentlemanly discussion, but I took the severity of it veryseriously. Heyward then gave me another loyalty pep talk. “Dan, weneed to stick together. You have always shown great allegiance tothe institution, and this is about saving the institution. The companywants CBS News to come out of this as well as we can, and we wantyou to come out of this as well as you can, too. Surely you mustregret what has happened.”“Of course I regret that we’re under attack, and that it’s giving usa mountain of bad publicity,” I said. “That’s why it’s so important todefend the story.”“We’re asking you to apologize. You need to do this for the goodof CBS News, and for your own good.”Heyward also told me that the network was going to announcethe establishment of an outside commission to investigate whathappened. I told him immediately that this was a bad idea. Wehadn’t done it during the McCarthy era, during our civil rightsbroadcasts or after sustaining heavy criticism about eitherTheSelling of the Pentagon orThe Uncounted Enemy. The UncountedEnemy was a documentary that aired at the beginning of 1982. Ithad been put together by Mike Wallace and George Crile, twoexcellent reporters, but it was revealed to have had some ethics andediting issues. At the time, CBS News conducted its own internalinvestigation of that case. While investigators said the reporting andeditingprocess had serious flaws, the story was true. So CBS, top tobottom, stood by it and defended it—including defending it in court.But that was then; Paley was in charge. This was now; Redstonewas in charge. A lot had changed since then, Heyward told me; intoday’s climate, the outside review was necessary. He assured methat the commission would be truly independent and that theimpartial individuals on it would be appointed by corporate. After thinking about it overnight, I agreed to be the one to readthe corporate speech of contrition, and also my own mea culpa.Andrew Heyward wrote it for me at my secretary’s computer. OnSeptember 20, I delivered the official CBS apology, and a separateone of my own: “I made a mistake,” I said. “I didn’t ask enough ofthe right questions, and I trusted a source who changed his story. Itturns out he misled us. There are no excuses… and I’m sorry for it.”I didn’t feel good about it going in, while I was reading it or after I’dfinished. They used the interview with Bill Burkett in the samebroadcast, cutting it down to just the snippets where he said that helied.On September 22, at 10:01 in the morning I was in a car beingdriven from a public appearance. I took a call from Andrew Heyward.“This is to inform you that we have appointed an independentcommission. It’s going to be led by Richard Thornburgh.”I slammed my fist down on the dashboard so hard I hurt myhand. I let out a string of expletives best left deleted. “Andrew,” Isaid loudly, “this is insane!”Richard Thornburgh had been the U.S. attorney general, firstunder Ronald Reagan and then under George H. W. Bush. He stillhad close ties to the Bush family. CBS had tapped Thornburgh, aRepublican lawyer from Bush’s cabinet, to investigate whether hisown former boss and close personal friend had used undue influenceto get his son into the Texas Air National Guard. It was the next bestthing to asking Bush to investigate himself.“Andrew, exactly what is independent and impartial about this?” Iasked.“Dan, you don’t understand,” he said coolly. “This is amasterstroke of genius. Dick Thornburgh has credibility with theBush people and the right wing, and with everyone who is giving usa hard time.”Andrew was very calm—which I was not. “Of course he hascredibility with them!” I shouted. “HeIS them!”“Dan, this is a courtesy call,” he continued somewhat stiffly. “Theannouncement has just been made.” Named with Thornburgh was Louis Boccardi, the recently retiredCEO of the Associated Press. Boccardi was indebted to the Bushfamily as well. As vice president, George H. W. Bush had beeninstrumental in securing the release of AP reporter Terry Anderson,who’d been held hostage by Hezbollah in Lebanon in the late 1980sand early 1990s. Two kangaroos had been issued black robes andinstalled in the Star Chamber. They were to render their verdict withall deliberate speed.Shortly thereafter, Andrew Heyward made the pilgrimage toWashington and apologized to the White House. For good measure,the network spiked a60 Minutes Sunday story by Ed Bradley on howforged documents had been deployed by the Bush administration tomake the case for going to war in Iraq.Then, on September 24, Viacom chief Sumner Redstone issuedthe following statement:From a Viacom standpoint, the election of a Republicanadministration is a better deal. Because the Republicanadministration has stood for many things we believe in,deregulation and so on… I vote for Viacom. Viacom is my life,and I do believe that a Republican administration is better formedia companies than a Democratic one.When I heard that, I was hotter than the anvil of the Devilhimself. After the establishment of the “independent” Thornburghcommission, however, I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised.Now, even the fig leaf of “independent” had been dropped. Viacom’snaked partisanship was out in the open. At the time, Viacom had anumber of matters before federal regulatory agencies. Although stillrebounding from the $550,000 fine levied by the FederalCommunications Commission over Janet Jackson’s Super Bowl“wardrobe malfunction,” the company was engaged in an aggressivelobbying effort targeted at key House Republicans and friends ofGeorge W. Bush to ensure the maintenance of loosened FCCregulations on media ownership, regulations that had a direct effect on Viacom’s bottom line. This was corporatization of the news at itsmost blatant, and Sumner Redstone seemed to be boasting of it tothe world.It now seemed absolutely clear why we had been ordered to dropany further investigation into Bush’s experience in the Texas AirNational Guard. CBS News was messing up Viacom’s game plan inWashington. Redstone’s agenda for an ever-bigger Viacom wasjeopardized by the emergence of truths about Bush’s past. Moonveshad to defer to Redstone if he wanted to inherit the throne. Had Iknown this, of course, I would have had nothing to do with the on-air apology or the punitive interview with Bill Burkett.It’s a shame that Leslie Moonves missed his moment to stand tall.At a time when he needed to put steel in his spine—to stand up toRedstone and Viacom on behalf of CBS, and in particular on behalfof CBS News—Moonves had Jell-O in his spine instead. It’s too badhe didn’t “man up,” in contemporary parlance. Here was his chanceto show leadership, to do what Bill Paley and Richard Salant andother leaders of CBS had done before. In my mind, history wouldhave been quite different if Moonves and Heyward had had the gutsCBS and particularly CBS News had been known for.Since they did not, from then on there was little doubt that wewere to be thrown under the bus—or perhaps thrown under the BigWagon.Election night 2004 ran long. I was on the air until about 6:00a.m. the next morning, until it became clear that George W. Bushhad been issued four more years. Not long after that, I took a callfrom Richard Leibner. “I met with Moonves and Heyward,” he said.“They want you gone from theEvening News chair as quickly asthey can get you out of there. Their proposition is that it’s better togo now, because if you wait till the Thornburgh report comes out, itcould be that they’d have to ask you to leave because of it.“I believe Moonves is under extraordinary heat from Sumner tohave you out the day before yesterday,” he continued, “but I canwork with Moonves. He really does have your best interests at heart,Dan. He likes you, and he’s very sorry this has happened. If youagree to make the announcement that you’re stepping down, you’ll segue into working on60 Minutes Sunday and everything will befine.”Although Richard was—and is—my friend and longtime agent, Istill had major concerns. The situation with CBS put him in a bit ofan awkward box, because he had to deal with Les Moonves onbehalf of several of his other clients. And, of course, I knew who thepeople on the commission were, and that most of the work wasbeing done by Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, Dick Thornburgh’s law firm.These were people with no background in journalism whatsoever.No way did I expect a fair shake from them.But I did expect a fair shake from Les Moonves when he said Iwould become a regular full correspondent on60 Minutes.On November 23, I announced that I would be leaving theCBSEvening News as of March 9, 2005, my 24th anniversary in theanchor chair.On January 10, the “independent” Thornburgh commissionregurgitated its final report, all 224 pages of it. While the reportboasted that CBS News “did not have any input or influence withrespect to the findings of the Panel,” the Thornburgh commissionhad engaged in an ongoing dialogue with CBS News executives andhad shared preliminary drafts with Heyward and Linda Mason, thenvice president for public affairs. I believe a later draft had been sentto Leslie Moonves while he was in Mexico on his honeymoon withCBSEarly Show news anchor andBig Brother host Julie Chen beforethe final version was released. Now that’s what I call independent.The report faulted our “myopic zeal” to be the first to broadcastthe story. Josh Howard and Betsy West were asked to resign. Sowere Esther Kartiganer, who gave the final okay to scripts, and MaryMurphy, senior producer. Both had worked under Howard. They alldid resign, eventually, but only after they lawyered up. We laterlearned that each of them, despite being shoved out the door,received a generous six- or seven-figure settlement (Howard’s isbelieved to have been more than $2 million.) These settlements insome cases came only after the employees threatened to sue. Theyalso received generous severance pay. All of that came with a gag order attached. Viacom had boughttheir silence. I have no hard feelings about these four good peopledoing this. I understand. I understand completely. Just as I hopethey will understand why I felt I had to go the way I did. Better offin personal finances, I would not consider agreeing to remain silentforever, and could afford to do so without hardship. These pay-for-silence deals raise questions not about why they were accepted butabout why they were offered.Andrew Heyward, who had signed off on the segment andpresumably had made the final decision as to when and with whatcontent it was to go on the air, escaped, at least for the moment.Even then, however, I thought it was only a temporary reprieve.Heyward left the company nine months later. His departure cameless than a week after his 55th birthday, the milestone he needed toreach to be eligible for early retirement benefits. I doubt that was acoincidence.Mary Mapes was fired outright. Mary had testified extensivelybefore the commission and had submitted lengthy documentation aswell. What she called her “meshing document,” based on the thicknotebook she’d been developing since she started working on thesegment, demonstrated how well the Killian memos fit within theframework of what we officially knew about Bush’s Air NationalGuard service. Although the 224-page report ballooned to doorstopheft with the addition of more than 700 pages of appendices, Mary’smeshing document was omitted.Thornburgh’s team found fault with the fact that we relied on thetwo document experts who believed that Killian’s signature wasgenuine. That said, they never interviewed James Pierce, the oneanalyst who never wavered in his belief in the authenticity of thedocuments, nor did they seek out their own expert analysts.The report also criticized the documents’ lack of a “chain ofcustody,” a bit of legalese that is miles beyond the journalistic norm.By this criterion, the editorial board of theWashington Post shouldhave required Bob Woodward to divulge the identity of Deep Throatbefore publishing a word about the Watergate break-in. As JamesGoodale, former vice chairman and general counsel for theNew York Times, pointed out, by this standard, theNew York Times shouldnever have published the Pentagon Papers. In a piece for theNewYork Review of Books, Goodale demolished the Thornburgh report:The panel was unable to decide whether the documents wereauthentic or not. It didn’t hire its own experts. It didn’tinterview the principal expert for CBS. It all but ignored animportant argument for authenticating the documents—“meshing.” It did not allow cross-examination. It introduceda standard for document authentication very difficult for newsorganizations to meet—“chain of custody”—and lastly, itcharacterized parts of the broadcast as false, misleading, orboth in a way that is close to nonsensical.No one should have been surprised that the kangaroo court hadrendered a kangaroo verdict. Astonishingly, CBS was amazed that itsatisfied no one. Because the report did not conclude that we hadforged the documents and did not find that my reporting waspolitically biased, it greatly angered the right-wing torch-and-pitchfork bearers who had started the controversy.I’ve spent a lot of time trying to figure out how a match lit on theInternet so quickly became a conflagration. The most plausibleexplanation is that there were a whole lot of folks blowing on theflame. On September 15, White House press secretary ScottMcClellan told a press briefing that the White House had releasedthe Killian memos we had shown them to other news organizations,or as he put it, to “everybody else, so you could look at themyourselves.” Presumably, at the time these news organizations wouldhave included Jeff Gannon at Talon News, who attended the dailyWhite House press briefing. Gannon was an odd member of theWhite House press corps who always seemed to have the insidestory. On September 13, Gannon had identified Mary as the produceron the Bush/Guard segment. On September 17, he had interviewedMary’s estranged father, who accused his daughter and me of plotting this “ever since Bush was elected”—four years earlier, in2000.Gannon was unmasked five months later as a fake correspondentfor a sham news agency. Talon News was in fact an appendage ofGOPUSA, a conservative website, which went a long way towardexplaining his “insider” information. It would be reasonable totheorize that copies of the documents went from the White House toJeff Gannon to Harry “Buckhead” MacDougald before the segmentaired.At this point, the White House was in full reelection mode, andthey knew it would be a tough fight. During Bush’s 2000 campaign,White House communications director Dan Bartlett had beenDirector of Rapid Response. As such, his job was to fight backquickly and aggressively against damaging news stories about thecandidate. With the Killian memos, we had in effect lobbed ahanging curveball into Bartlett’s wheelhouse.Bartlett had been with Bush since his days in the Texas governor’soffice. Among his other responsibilities, he had served as thegovernor’s liaison to the Texas National Guard and held that positionin the year Bush’s files had allegedly been scrubbed. Before workingwith Bush, he’d worked at Karl Rove & Associates. Following hisdeparture from the White House, Bartlett became CEO of PublicStrategies, Inc., a PR firm specializing in crisis response.He also became a political analyst for CBS News.When the Thornburgh report was published, it was my wife whoprovided the perspective I needed to hear. “You got into a fight withthe president of the United States,” she told me. “During the heat ofhis reelection campaign. What did you think was going to happen?”What happened was that we spoke truth to power. And powerhad bellowed back through every bullhorn it could command. At thetime, it was loud enough to drown out the truth. CHAPTER 3RootsI can’t remember a time when I didn’t want to be a reporter. Myparents were avid newspaper readers. The news mattered; they hadyeasty discussions about it over dinner. Even when I was very young—four or five years old—I remember seeing them not only readingthe paper but being thoroughly engrossed in it. To them, journalistswere important people. They had great respect for reporters, andthey passed that respect on to me as a child.That didn’t mean they agreed with everything they read. Myfather often took issue with the editorials and expressed hisdispleasure by flinging the paper up against the wall. “Byrl!” he’d yellat my mother. “Drop theHouston Press!”My mother, Veda Byrl Page Rather, had been through this exercisemany times before. At the time, my hometown of Houston had threedaily papers: theChronicle, thePost and thePress, and in our housethey came and went out of favor in rotation, depending on myfather’s most recent reaction to them. As I was growing up, wecanceled each of them at least five times. That day’sPress was justthe latest in a series of papers to leave the table airborne.“Irvin,” Mother said, “we’ve already dropped thePost and theChronicle.” My father’s name was Daniel Irvin Rather, but everyonecalled him either Irvin or Rags.“In that case,” he muttered, “get theSt. Louis Post-Dispatch.”“But Irvin, it’ll take two or three days to get here by post.”“That’s all right… Goddammit, I’m finished with these!” The wonder of it was that it wasn’t just talk. My father didn’t justread newspapers; he devoured them. Much to my mother’sdispleasure, he stockpiled the ones he hadn’t had time to getthrough in one sitting. He barricaded his favorite chair with them,and the piles never seemed to get smaller. In a house that wasanything but spacious, his stacks of old newspapers were a problem,but they were sacrosanct. He refused to let my mother get rid ofthem.Our small house at 1432 Prince Street was located in what wasknown as the Heights Annex. The Heights itself was a neighborhoodthat had started out at the turn of the century with dreams ofgrandeur and fancy Victorian gingerbread houses. By the 1930s,both the dreams and the houses had faded. The Heights Annex wasmany rungs below faded. There was nothing grand about it, neverhad been. What we think of as standard improvements were few.The streets were still unpaved. The houses weren’t shacks, but someweren’t much more than that, either. There were many vacant lots—and some outhouses—in the neighborhood. Although burglary wasrare, domestic violence and street fights were not.As far as the rest of Houston was concerned, the Annex was thewrong side of the tracks. If you weren’t from here, you didn’t comehere. And if you were from here, getting someplace else wasn’teasy; the nearest bus and streetcar were miles away, as was thenearest grocery. We minimized trips to the market by keeping a cowand some chickens, and by growing vegetables on one of the emptylots.My mother worked part-time as a waitress and also took insewing. She did whatever she could to supplement the familyincome, but always had dinner on the table when my father gothome from work. My father was the breadwinner and in everyrespect the head of the household. He was a pipeliner, which meanthe was a specialty ditchdigger, digging trenches for the pipes thatcarried crude oil from the wellheads inland to the port area on theGulf. It was tough, sweaty, manual labor, but in the Depression ofthe 1930s, it was steady work, and we knew that was a blessing. In the neighborhood, the fact that my father always had a job madehim something of a local VIP.Even as a small boy, I understood that there were many otherfamilies in the Annex who were not so fortunate. Most men had noregular employment; many were on the dole. Several evenings aweek there would be a soft knock on our back door. Men presentedthemselves hat in hand, asking as politely as they knew howwhether there might be anything left over from our supper. Theirfamilies huddled a few paces off to the side. After satisfying himselfthat the family was worthy, my father would allow my mother towrap up something for them. If we didn’t have enough to spare, hewould call other neighbors on their behalf. The message to me wasclear: we were not flush, but we were not in need, and it behoovedus to share what we had with those who had less.There was never a lot of money for extras in our family, but to myparents, newspapers were an essential, not a luxury. After myfather’s outburst, wedid get theSt. Louis Post-Dispatch. We wereprobably the only people in a 50-mile radius of Houston—and maybethe whole state of Texas—who did. Eventually, one year we endedup with theChristian Science Monitor, and that had to come all theway from Boston.Looking back, our family’s love of news influenced me greatly. Ialways knew I wanted to be a reporter; the biggest dream I daredhope for was to hire on with theHouston Chronicle when I grew up.In my child’s brain, one step toward reaching that goal was to workon the school newspaper. But at William G. Love Elementary School,we didn’t have a school paper, so I decided to start my own.My mother always did anything she could to encourage me. Sheput her support behind my idea of a school newspaper and went tothe school to see what could be done. She found a willing ally inMrs. Simmons, Love’s principal. With the help of my mother and Mrs.Taylor, my first-grade teacher, I put together my newspaper. Mrs.Simmons had it typed up and copied as a stencil and distributed toeach grade. It was the beginning of my career in journalism; I thinkI was missing my two front teeth at the time. There’s an Indian saying in Texas: “From time to time in life, youshould sit tall on your horse and look back over the trails you havetraveled.” From this particular vantage point on my particular horse,it is clear that one of the great godsends of my life has been a seriesof excellent teachers. The first of these were at Love Elementary.At that time, it was a pluperfect example of what you hope anelementary school will be, and mind you, this was in the toughestwhite neighborhood in town. It went from first through sixth grade;we had no kindergarten. Mrs. Simmons, by force of her intellect andher diligence, made it a nearly ideal place to educate and encourageyoung students. She found a way to nurture not just my dreams, butthe dreams of each child in her care. She always let us know that wecould do anything we wanted to do, if we were willing to behardworking and persistent. Today we would say she empowered us.Mrs. Simmons ruled William G. Love as a personal fiefdom. Shewas given very little direction from the central school district, nevermind the school board. It was very much her school, and she hiredvery good teachers who shared her vision. I can still name every oneof them. Each was excellent in her own way, and all of them weretruly memorable. Mrs. Taylor, very much the earth mother, took methrough first and second grade and then passed me on to MissSpencer, who was much more of a schoolmarm. Each of themrecognized my interests and nourished my abilities. It was MissSpencer who pushed me to improve both my handwriting and myspelling, not just as academic disciplines but as practical skills anaspiring reporter needed to have. (I did improve under herinstruction, but I remained a poor speller all through school, andbeyond.)I must have been about seven or eight one summer when I met“the lady at the park,” at least that’s what we called her. Lookingback, I’m sure she was some sort of social worker hired by the city,but she gathered me and my friends around her at the park andread to us, then asked if we’d like to go to the library. She took us tothe Heights Library, not just once but several times thereafter. Iloved it so much that at the end of the summer she took me to themain library downtown, which was a major expedition. The building looked like something out of the Knights of the Round Table, and theinside was even more astonishing. Who knew so many books evenexisted? That summer with the lady at the park made a lifelongreader out of me, and my Houston Heights Library card was one ofmy most cherished possessions.At home, the newspaper was a constant presence, and the radiowas always on in the evenings. My parents listened intently. Throughthe late 1930s they followed the militant resurgence of Germanywith increasing alarm. After hearing aboutMein Kampf, my parents—these two people who worked with their hands—got a copy andread it. They discussed the book and the ominous developments inEurope with Uncle John, my father’s younger brother, sometimes lateinto the night. As a kid, I felt privileged to sit around the edges oftheir discussions, listening to them. There were plenty of people atthe time who were impressed with what Hitler had accomplished andwere either unaware of or untroubled by the darker side of Nazism.You’d hear it said often enough: “Hitler pulled Germany out ofdespair; maybe this guy is on to something.” My father wasn’thaving any of it. “He’s a dictator and a dangerous man,” he declared.When Neville Chamberlain allowed Hitler to take the Sudetenlandfrom Czechoslovakia in 1938, I can remember my father and UncleJohn discussing it. I sensed that they knew this was a decisivemoment, and not because they believed for an instant thatChamberlain’s sellout of the Czechs had brought “peace in our time.”When the Nazis moved on Poland in September 1939, there wereearnest conversations about what would happen next.My parents had their radio favorites. They made a point to hearEdward R. Murrow, Eric Sevareid and Charles Collingwood duringthis period before the war, a period Winston Churchill would later callthe “gathering storm.” Although they also listened to broadcasterslike H. V. Kaltenborn, Gabriel Heatter and Lowell Thomas, namesthat have now faded into the mist, their radio favorites were thereporters on CBS who became known as “the Murrow Boys.”All too soon, I was listening to far more radio than I could haveever wanted. I didn’t have a choice. When I was ten, I got sick. Itstarted simply enough: My feet hurt. For the longest time, I didn’t mention it to anyone. In the Heights Annex, whenever you hurt,whatever was hurting, we all knew to suck it up and keep going.There wasn’t a lot of coddling to be expected.Except that it kept getting worse. The pain intensified as it movedup my legs to my ankles and knees, and then began affecting mywrists. I had frequent sore throats. I was losing weight. I had noappetite and no energy. Everything hurt. Doctors were puzzled formany months until Dr. R. Louis Cope diagnosed my illness asrheumatic fever. Dr. Cope said there was no drug he could give mefor it.Although Alexander Fleming had already discovered penicillin, ithad not yet become part of a doctor’s arsenal against infection.Worse yet, the long-term prognosis for survivors of rheumatic feverwas potentially dire. Patients were at risk of developing carditis—inflammation of the heart muscle. Too often this was followed bycongestive heart failure and lifetime disability, or death. Only by notovertaxing the heart could this fate be avoided.“I want him in bed and I don’t want him to move,” Dr. Cope toldmy mother sternly.This has to be one of the hardest things for any 10-year-old tohear, and it was harder still for me. I loved school and I loved sports,baseball and football most of all. I’d always been an active child. Uptill then I had lived something of a Huck Finn existence. In summersmy friend Georgie Hoyt and I had fashioned rafts to float along theBuffalo Bayou. When we weren’t skinny-dipping or huntingarmadillos, he played Davy Crockett to my Jim Bowie. Now in aninstant, all that was gone. I became an invalid. I was to bebedridden. Bedridden seriously, as in using a bedpan.“For how long?” we asked.“For as long as it takes,” Dr. Cope replied. And even he couldn’tguarantee that I’d ever be truly well again.During those first few weeks I was petrified, literally scared tomove. I didn’t understand carditis, but I surely understood what thefuture held for a kid from the Annex who was disabled. My mothermonitored my heartbeat and reported to the doctor on a regularbasis. It was many painful months before I showed any signs of improvement at all. Eventually I got permission from Dr. Cope to getup and use the bathroom, and I treated each trip like the greatpajama safari that it was.He did warn us that rheumatic fever had a tendency to recur, andso it was with me. I had two long bouts of it, one from age 10 to11½, the second from age 12 to 13½. Essentially I spent almost allof junior high in bed. I was officially enrolled in Hamilton MiddleSchool, but it was pretty much a wipeout for me, because I had tobe homeschooled. That makes it sound far more structured than itwas. No teacher came to the house; they would sporadically sendhome whatever material we were studying, and Mom kept me up tospeed with the schoolwork. From time to time I submitted papers. Ina sense, during these years I was pretty much self-taught. It was along, depressing time. My friends sometimes came by to cheer meup, but too often their visits just hammered home the fact that I wasan invalid.My parents had never touched a book on psychology, but theyknew a lot about love, and about the importance of familytogetherness. My mother turned our home life upside down toaccommodate my illness; she would have done the same for mybrother, Don, or my sister, Patricia. To keep me included in the life ofthe family, she served our meals on trays, and most nights everyoneate in my bedroom with me. Before I got sick, all of us kids had sleptin the back room together. Now, to give me something to look at, mymother completely rearranged the sleeping quarters in our tinyhouse. I was moved into my parents’ room in the front, overlookingPrince Street. They squeezed into the back bedroom with mysiblings. I can only imagine how cramped that was, but if my fatherever complained, I didn’t hear it. To give me something to listen to,they put the radio within easy reach.So there I was, by myself with the radio. All day long. That’s onereason why I like country music so much: Bob Wills and His TexasPlayboys sang to me every day. Mostly, however, I had the MurrowBoys in my ear. I looked forward to Edward R. Murrow coming onthe air: “This is London.” He had a remarkable ability to place hislisteners in the center of the action and to convey a sense of time and place with his words alone. As he spoke, it was easy for me toimagine myself looking up into the skies of Britain as the Luftwaffecame overhead. I listened to Charles Collingwood, he of the polishedOxford diction—even though I probably hadn’t heard of Oxford,England, at that time. Believe me, in the Heights Annex, Oxford wasas far away as the planet Neptune. In my mind, I can still hear EricSevareid’s voice. I liked him, too, even though he kind of mumbledsometimes.The Murrow Boys reported on both the battles and the politics ofthe Second World War. Murrow was in London during the Blitz;Sevareid was in Paris as the Germans marched in; and Collingwoodwas with the troops on the beaches of Normandy as the Allies cameashore. It was the beginning of my understanding of “boots on theground” reporting—of the need to go where the news was beingmade.I can trace my desire to be a reporter back to my parents’immersion in the news and to the many hours spent listening tosome of the best journalists history has ever known. By the time Ifinished my last attack of rheumatic fever, I was very committed tonews in the same way I can see my eldest grandson is dedicated togolf. I can see myself in him. By the time I was 13, becoming areporter was my driving dream.The question then became whether my body would ever measureup to my ambition. I was not prepared when Dr. Cope finally gaveme permission to get out of bed for good. It was late in the schoolyear in the eighth grade. During my long convalescence, all mymuscles had atrophied, and I was extremely self-conscious—embarrassed, even—about how “different” I’d become. I was pastywhite and feeble. I no longer fit in, and the Heights was always aplace that had little sympathy for anyone with a disability. I was veryweak, so weak that I lost confidence in myself. I wasn’t able to keepup with Georgie and Homer and my other friends and feared that Inever would. Mentally and physically, I was quite literally a shadowof the active boy I’d been before.I’m not sure how, but my father knew this was a critical time forme. He arranged for me to take a summer job on a brush-cutting crew. The crew was organized by a neighbor who had a smallsurveying company, Jeff Stramler. His son Charlie had been a closefriend of mine, but Charlie had died of leukemia a couple of yearsearlier. Officially they listed my age on the crew sheet as 16, buteveryone knew I was only 14. At first I was so frail that I had troubledoing the work, but no excuses were allowed. Hard as it was, thelast thing I wanted to do was let my father down, and Charlie’s dadin the bargain. My parents had instilled persistence in me; I wasraised to never be a quitter. My father gave me quite a few lecturesabout how I had to keep up with the others on the crew—most ofwhom were rough-and-tumble grown men of less than upstandingcharacter. He told me that I had to shoulder my fair share of theload; otherwise I’d be sent home. On the pipe-laying crew, my jobwas to help the surveyor to provide a clear line of sight for him tokeep the pipe running straight. We took away any heavy brush,vines or even trees that might be in the way. I spent months living insmall hotels before I came home at the end of my 14th summer.I must have been quite a sight: this scrawny toothpick with a redbandana tied around my head, railroad engineer’s cap perched ontop, khaki work shirt buttoned to the neck, and a yard-long macheteswinging in its holster from my belt. We worked through forests andsnake-infested swamps all summer long. The work was all IndianaJones and Paul Bunyan and no Edward R. Murrow, but I survivedand eventually thrived. It was a lifesaving, life-changing experiencefor me, and a true turning point. As I got my strength back, my self-confidence returned as well.Having skated through middle school, I looked forward to ReaganHigh School. We had some outstanding students, and the school hada pretty good overall reputation for discipline and academics. In fartoo many cases, however, the boys had to make one of three careerchoices: They went to the oilfields, they joined law enforcement orthey went to jail. Many dropped out of school early.I struggled with schoolwork at first, but it was again my goodfortune to have an outstanding teacher. My particular angel in highschool was Miss Wilkerson, who taught English. More important, atleast from my point of view, she was also the adviser to the school paper, theJohn Reagan High School News. From the first, sherecognized how important my dream of becoming a reporter was tome, and she mentored me all the way through to graduation.Graduation… then what? My parents held dissimilar views on thesubject. My father had started but did not finish the 10th grade.When he was a boy, it was expected that children would helpsupport the family as soon as they were able. For him, the idea thatI might make a living working in the oilfields was a viable possibility.He used to call newspapers “the poor man’s university,” and Isuspect it was his belief that it was the only university I would everget to see.Not so my mother. She was a firm believer in the idea of betteringyourself, a process that began with getting as good an education aspossible. She not only wanted me to graduate from high school, shewas absolutely adamant about my going to college. She’d beenwhispering to me about it all through my childhood. She didn’t havea clue about how she was going to make it happen; she just knew Iwas going. My father didn’t approve as much as he acquiesced.Generally speaking he ruled the roost, but on this issue he did notcross her. He just didn’t know how we were going to pay for it.I had that all figured out. Football would be my ticket, or so Ithought. Then as now, high school football was a religion in Texas.One thing that spurred me to regain my strength after havingrheumatic fever was the desire to play, a desire that also kept mefrom dropping out of high school. And football at Reagan was a bigdeal, aFriday Night Lights big deal. We filled the stadium withupward of 20,000 enthusiastic fans every week.Pretty much by force of will, I made myself into a reasonablygood football player. I was no superstar, but by the time I was asenior, I was a starter. Miss Wilkerson didn’t puncture my love offootball, but she wanted me to stay focused on my desire to becomea reporter. She knew I needed more schooling, and at the end offootball season my senior year, I was sorely in need of a realitycheck. I was born in October, so I started school in February andgraduated in January, which was common. In January 1950, rightbefore the graduation ceremony, Miss Wilkerson called me in for a good talking-to. “Dan, you must go to college,” she said. “Right nowyou’re much too fixated on football. If football is your ticket to highereducation, then so be it, but never forget that it’s a means to anend. You weren’t born to be a coach. Keep your eye on your truecalling—your career as a journalist.”She backed up that advice with concrete support. That winterthere was a conference of high school journalists. I don’t know whyshe thought it was important, but Miss Wilkerson was determinedthat I attend. I had not planned to go, but she insisted. In fact, sheloaned me her car as transportation. I was 18 years old and hadn’tbeen driving all that long. I was so nervous all the way there and allthe way back that I stopped at every light even before it turned red.I remember thinking to myself, “God, I can’t have a wreck in MissWilkerson’s car.”In February 1950, my mother proudly accompanied her newlyminted high school graduate to Huntsville, Texas, to enroll me inSam Houston State Teachers College (now Sam Houston StateUniversity). Even though the Rathers owned a car, we took aGreyhound bus to get there, which was a vote of no confidence inthe ability of our 1938 Oldsmobile to survive the trip. She had prettymuch all of the family savings in her purse: two war bonds thatwouldn’t cover the $38 tuition, and another $15 in cash that she’dscraped together to make up the difference.A few weeks earlier, I had hitchhiked the 75 miles to Huntsville totalk with the football coach, a man named Puny Wilson. When I toldhim I was a football player, he was not immediately impressed, butfinally mumbled that he’d be glad to have me come out for theteam. What he meant was that I was welcome to come participate inspring football camp, but in my mind I inflated this to mean that Iwas all but guaranteed a football scholarship. Foolish? Yes.Delusional? That, too. But playing football was my only strategy forgetting a college education. I had no plan B.From the first day of spring camp, I was in over my head. I hungaround practice like some unwanted dog. Coach Puny couldn’t runme off, even when it started to become pretty clear I wasn’t going toget the scholarship. I was hanging on by my fingertips when the good professor HughCunningham came to my rescue. Prof Cunningham taughtjournalism, and he was yet another wonderful teacher who showedup in my life exactly when I needed one.I was at another turning point. Prof Cunningham was not mucholder than I was—he was probably 27 or 28 years old at the time.With only 900 students in the college, his department consisted ofseven journalism majors—which made it possible for him to giveeach of us a lot of personal attention. In his words, he was turningout a “handcrafted product.”He came out to watch me at football practice one afternoon. Iwas an end, and we were running end sweeps. I was getting wipedout on every play. After practice he scraped my shattered ego off thegridiron and tried to talk some sense into me. “Son, you’ve got toget out of this,” he said. “You’re not a football player. You’re nevergoing to be a football player.” The words stung, but he continued,and as he continued he offered hope and a lifeline. “It’s notcompatible with my making a reporter out of you. Let’s grab somesupper and talk about how you’re going to become a greatjournalist.”He could see that for me, playing football was a dream that diedhard. Moreover, he understood right away that it threatened to takemy dreams of becoming a reporter down with it. And he knew thatthe threat was imminent: Without a football scholarship, I had noidea how I was going to eat or sleep with a roof over my head,much less stay in school. I was painfully close to dropping out, so helet me sleep on the couch in his front room for a bit until I couldmake arrangements at a boardinghouse. His wife, I’m sure, was lessthan delighted, but without his intervention I’d have been gone fromHuntsville in a matter of days.With that, Cunningham took me under his wing, just as he tookevery one of his “handcrafted” students. Knowing how badly Ineeded income to stay in school, he helped me cobble together anassortment of part-time jobs. I worked at a filling station, at thelocal equivalent of a Tastee-Freez stand and as the publicist for the sports department. None of these gigs paid very much, but takentogether they were enough to keep me in school and in groceries.Eventually he landed me a job at KSAM, the local radio station,where I was a virtual one-man band. I was a DJ; I did livebroadcasts of gospel singing at night, which was sponsored by thelocal funeral home. Occasionally, I sang with them. Most important, Idid play-by-play for sporting events. Basketball, baseball, track, anda whole lot of football—black high school football on Thursday, whitehigh school football on Friday, college games on Saturday. Although Ididn’t fully realize it at the time, the skill of ad-libbing I developedduring those many hours on the air would eventually proveinvaluable.What did Prof Cunningham see in me? I think more than anythingelse, he saw my determination. I think he said to himself, “This kid israw. He doesn’t write as well as he thinks he does, and he’s got a lotto learn, but he has the will, and the force of his energy.”Prof Cunningham was also very practical. He was tough on mebecause he knew a whole lot about how tough it was out there inthe real world of journalism. He also had no illusions about whereSam Houston stood in the academic pecking order. To put it bluntlyin the vernacular of the day, it was a cow college. “Look, Dan,” hesaid, “you’re going to graduate from Sam Houston State TeachersCollege. No one is going to give you a break. You have it in you tobe really good, but your biggest challenge is going to be whetheryou can make a living doing this. You’re going to have a hard timegetting a job, and you’ll be competing with guys from Harvard andStanford. They will be better educated than you. They’ll probablywrite better than you do, too.”Based on that understanding, Prof Cunningham took it uponhimself to level the playing field as much as he could. “Even thoughyou have a certain number of journalism classes that are required bythe curriculum for your major, what you do in them does not matter,”he said simply. “Everything you need to know about journalism I’mgoing to teach you through the school newspaper. Your job is to takeas many electives as you can. Take a full load, and extra classes inEnglish and algebra.” What he was trying to do was make sure I got a broad liberal artseducation. In that regard, he knew, there was only so much I’d beable to glean from my coursework at Sam Houston. In 1952, theEncyclopaedia Britannica published a series of 54 volumes that theycalled Great Books of the Western World. Put together by faculty atthe University of Chicago, today it might be viewed by some as theDead White Males collection. At the time, however, it was takenseriously as a survey of western civilization conveyed throughoriginal works of literature, history, philosophy, mathematics and thesciences.Thanks to the lady at the park, I already loved to read, but Ihadn’t been exposed to anything like this ever before. I had neverheard of Tolstoy. I had never read Euripides. Now Prof Cunninghamwanted me to read all 54 volumes, from beginning to end. He feltthat reading the classics would be one way for this kid from thesticks to stand toe to toe with the sons of privilege in the jobmarket. I didn’t read every volume of the Great Books all the waythrough, but I did read some parts in each one. I became familiarenough with them to at least recognize the names and some of theideas—which was more or less what Prof Cunningham wanted.Hugh Cunningham was a pivotal figure in my life in so manyways. I paid him back by getting him fired.Not on purpose, of course. My time at Sam Houston coincidedwith the Korean War. As soon as it began, the college started losingstudents. Young men either were drafted or they transferred toschools with reserve units. Concerned by the attrition, the schoolquickly put together a reserve outfit, and all of us male studentsjoined it. Except that it was kind of a bogus unit, because the schooldidn’t have the money for real equipment. We didn’t even haveuniforms; we lined up wearing baseball caps.My roommate at the time was a guy named Cecil “the Weeper”Tuck. Cecil was a good ole boy who had been introduced to alcoholat an early age. He was also prone to fits of melancholy—at thetime, we were too young to think there might be a connectionbetween one and the other. Like me, Cecil wrote for the campusnewspaper, and the two of us took turns writing pieces mocking the school’s hastily formed Army reserve unit as the sham that it was.We were pretty blunt about it, too. “If this is supposed to be trainingfor the war, we’ll all die in the first round” is a pretty fair example ofwhat we were writing. This did not go down well with collegeadministrators, who wanted desperately to retain their newlyestablished campus reserve outfit. They pressed our faculty adviser—Cunningham—to “control” the mischief-makers, Cecil and me.No dice. Prof Cunningham turned them down flat. “I’m trainingthese people to be fiercely independent journalists,” he said. “I can’ttrain them to do that by censoring what they write in the paper.”The administration took a hard line. “You are the head of theJournalism Department, and we don’t like what we’re reading. Put astop to it.”He refused. “The only way I can stop them from writing satireabout the reserve program,” he told them, “is to censor them. I’mnot going to do that.” In short order, Prof Cunningham was asked toleave.Sam Houston’s loss was eventually Florida’s gain. After two yearsas the editor of theBryan Daily Eagle, Hugh Cunningham was hiredby the University of Florida to teach journalism. He became arevered, nigh on legendary figure on campus. In 2001, theUniversity of Florida endowed a journalism chair in his name.It was now 1953. My mentor was gone, but because I had takenextra coursework like Prof Cunningham told me to, I had enoughunits to graduate early. I was anxious to get out; despite my feelingsabout our rinky-dink reserves program, I wanted to go into themilitary. I knew that since I’d had rheumatic fever I was not eligiblefor the draft, but I also knew I was fully recovered and able-bodied.I’d played football; I’d worked several summers in the oilfields. I wasready to serve my country, and I wanted to go to Korea. I wasactually worried that the war would end before I got there.I graduated in the summer of 1953 and there was a formalcommencement ceremony that both my parents attended. Theystood on the grass of Pritchett Field, which was the football stadium.The school orchestra played the Sam Houston alma mater, the SamHouston fight song, the national anthem, and “America the Beautiful.” My parents were thrilled and very proud of me. My fatherhad never been on a college campus, and when he saw my diploma,I can remember the look of astonishment—almost disbelief—on hisface. And the pride.I joined the Marines soon thereafter. Even though I enlisted inSeptember, I could not be inducted right away, largely, as Iunderstand it, because the war was winding down. I actually taughtjournalism at Sam Houston for the fall term until I shipped out toSan Diego for boot camp in January of ’54. The Corps had a strict listof debilitating diseases that you could not have ever had. When Ienlisted, I simply didn’t mention anything about the rheumatic fever.I got away with my deception for just a couple of months; when itwas discovered, I was abruptly given a medical discharge—over myvociferous protest. Despite several weeks of cleaning latrines, I wasterminated. I used my mustering-out pay to take a long bus trip insearch of work. I traveled from San Diego to Los Angeles, SanFrancisco, Salt Lake City, Casper (Wyoming) and Denver, but therewas a recession on and there was no work to be had.I returned to Houston at the end of the summer to job huntcloser to home. I spent more months knocking on doors until Ifinally was given a tryout at theHouston Chronicle, writingobituaries. Despite Miss Spencer’s best efforts in the third grade,however, I was still a poor speller. I spent a lot of time looking upwords in the dictionary. My work ethic was solid—the city editor sawthat I got there early, stayed late and worked hard, but it wasn’tenough. Especially with obituaries, there should be no misspelledwords. Because I was too slow, it wasn’t working out;I wasn’tworking out. The editor took pity on me and sent me over to theRice Hotel, where theChronicle’s radio station, KTRH, washeadquartered. He thought they might have an opening. He knewI’d worked at KSAM in college, and he put in a good word for me.In addition to my good fortune to have excellent teachers, therehave been many times in my career when I received help at crucialmoments from absolute strangers. The news director at KTRH was acigarettes and whiskey lifetime newsman named Bob Hart. (Bob wasby no means alone in this regard. In those days, reporters were notorious for their consumption of alcohol and cigarettes. Thestereotype of the hard-drinking, nicotine-stained journalist wasrooted in fact.)At the time, radio news was changing from rip-and-read toactually covering local events, and Bob needed somebody to coverthe courts, city hall and the police beat. “You know how to write anewscast?” he asked as I walked in.“Yes sir, I do,” I replied.“Well, write one,” he demanded, as he headed upstairs to thePress Club for his customary two-drink lunch. Hugh Cunningham hadtaught me well. I got the wires and the dispatch from the policestation. I had the five-minute newscast written before he got back.I got the job, and it was another turning point for me. I started atthe princely sum of $45 a week, which was not good pay, but Ididn’t care. I had a full-time job in journalism; someone was payingme money to do what I loved.I immediately discovered that KTRH was a world apart fromKSAM. KSAM whispered over the Huntsville airwaves at 250 watts.KTRH boomed all over the Gulf Coast with 50,000. When I began, Iwas still rough around the edges, and it was station manager BillBryan who voluntarily took on the job of sanding them down. Billwas a smooth gentleman who had been an announcer forbandleader Kay Kyser. He was handsome and what we used to call asnappy dresser. I would come to work in a short-sleeved shirt, whichwas de rigueur for hot, muggy Houston, or so I thought. Not Bill. Heled by example—his work attire was a suit, tie and long-sleevedshirt. He not only showed me how to dress, he instructed me in theniceties of personal grooming. When my full head of black hair wasshowing signs of a dandruff problem, he told me how to get rid of it.This was radio, so why did I care? I cared because KTRH’ssecretary was a beautiful, vibrant young woman with a killer smile,and I desperately wanted to make a good impression on her. Thespark was there right from the beginning—bingo bombshell holysmoke. She was smart, and that was one of the many attractions.She also had a figure that would make a bishop kick out a stainedglass window—leggy, chesty, tiny waist, winning smile and sparkling eyes—just a beautiful girl. Her name was Jean Goebel, and I wascrazy about her from the first moment I saw her. I’m still crazy abouther. On our first date, I remember going to a Tex-Mex place with asmall dance floor. Because I thought it was so special, I saved up tobuy the first of many bottles of Lancers screw-top wine, which Ithought was very sophisticated at that time. Jean was appropriatelyappreciative.Jean Goebel became Jean Goebel Rather on April 21, 1957. Thereason we chose that particular date is that it is also the anniversaryof the Battle of San Jacinto, when in 1836 Texas finally wasseparated from Mexico. We were married in Jean’s Lutheran churchoff the Gulf Freeway in Houston. Her family and my family bothattended. Some of our friends attended, including Cecil “theWeeper” Tuck, I recall. My colleagues from KTRH were there, too. Infact, they held a small bachelor party for me, and many of us werestill recovering the next day. For our honeymoon, Jean and I droveto Monterrey, Mexico, in a used 1954 Pontiac. I am afraid we hit onegoat en route.I stayed at KTRH for six years. Six years might strike some as along time to stay at a radio station—too long, some might say. Iwould disagree. People then tended to stay at one job longer thanthey do now. More than that, however, I stayed because KTRH gaveme a productive apprenticeship in broadcast journalism. While thereI honed the skill of ad-libbing to the point where it became agenuine strength. I learned to take radio airtime and hold radioairtime indefinitely with ad-libbing. Meanwhile, however, Bill Bryancontinued to nudge me along by reminding me that even though Iwas learning valuable skills, KTRH was never going to be a placewhere I would be recognized as a great reporter. Maybe, heprodded, I should think about moving on.By now I had worked my way up to become director of news andcommunity affairs. My salary had grown to about $9,200 a year, butthis was hardly enough to raise a family on. Robin, our daughter,was born in 1958. I made extra money by doing football, basketballand baseball play-by-play, but we were still strapped. Bob Levy, an acquaintance, told me about an opening attelevision station KHOU, which was the Houston CBS affiliate. Levywas a baseball nut and a phenomenal statistician. I met him atpregame workouts and batting practice when I was doing play-by-play for the local professional minor league Houston Buffs (as inBuffaloes, or Bison). One night, Levy told me, “Dan, television is thething of the future; this is where the opportunities are. You would begood at it, and you really should give them a call.”I confess I was a little slow to appreciate the importance of TV,but KHOU was offering $10,200, and Jean and I were expectinganother baby. I was offered a tryout with program director CalvinJones. Cal had been hired away from KDKA in Pittsburgh—highlyregarded as one of the best local news outfits in the business—tobuild the station into a competitor. At the time, KHOU was a distantthird in the market.Before my audition, he explained to me that eye contact was veryimportant, and then he told me to do a 15-minute newscast.Because I already knew the day’s news well and had done so muchradio earlier that day, I didn’t use a script. Jones was surprised, tosay the least. “You never looked down!” he exclaimed. “I never sawanyone who could do that.”“You told me to look at the camera,” I replied simply.I started at KHOU in January 1960. It was another turning point,and once again I was the beneficiary of the kindness of strangers.Cal Jones became another one of my enthusiastic mentors. He hadgotten into television relatively early and had already been in it forfive or six years. Jones really taught me what I needed to know tobe in TV, which was pretty much everything, since I was startingwith a knowledge base of zero. Television lighting at the time wasnotoriously harsh, and I have always had a heavy beard. Cal taughtme how to apply makeup and pressed powder to hide it from thecamera. (Ironically, just a few months later presidential candidateRichard Nixon refused to put on makeup to hide his own heavybeard for his televised debate with John Kennedy. His visible fiveo’clock shadow and generally tired appearance was a majorcontributing factor to his loss that November.) My title at KHOU was news director, but the joke was that I wassimply the director of myself. The news department was me full-time, a part-time cameraman Bob Wolf and Bob Levy, who wasworking in the program department but helped out on an as-neededbasis.I had to shoot some of my own stories, so Cal, Levy and Wolfgave me a crash course in the operation of a Bell & Howell silentmovie camera. I learned how to put the film in, how to shoot, howto take the camera apart and how to remove the film. Once it wasout of the camera, the film had to be sent downtown to beprocessed.Since this was almost all silent film, everything was scripted withvoice-over, and I wrote my own script. On the left side of the pagewas the narration; on the right was a description of the film snippetthat went with it. There were no film editors at the station. It wasmy job to select the snippets and physically splice them together.The splicer was a hand-run piece of equipment with glue in it. I puttwo pieces of film into it, pressed down and held it long enough tomake sure the glue set. When it didn’t, my skill at ad-libbing came inhandy.I did two 15-minute broadcasts, one at 6:00 p.m., right afterDouglas Edwards with the network news, and the second at 10:00p.m. When it came time for the broadcast, there was no studiocameraman. There was a camera in front of me and a person in thecontrol room. I had a wire running up my sleeve with a button. I’dsay, “The mayor had a news conference today, and this is what itlooked like.” With that, I’d push the button, and the man in thecontrol room would roll the silent footage while I narrated over it. Ihad a second button in my other hand for commercials. Until I gotup to speed, there were a few instances when I pushed the wrongbutton, which meant that the ads ran instead of the news piece thatwas supposed to be there. My learning curve went up pretty quickly,though—it had to.During the day, I went out and covered the same beat I’d had atKTRH, except now I had a camera. I’d be out all day filming thestories before sending the footage to the processor. After that, it was a push to get it spliced and scripted and ready for airtime. Fairlysoon it became obvious that getting the film processed wasexpensive, both in time and in dollars.I went to our station manager, a proper Bostonian named JamesRichdale, and proposed the idea of buying a processor. He said wecouldn’t afford it. In the interim, we had hired cameraman Bob Wolffull-time. Somewhere between Wolf and Levy, we found an Armysurplus processor that was about the size of a coffin. You put thefilm in one end and ran it through the chemicals inside. It came outthe other end and into a dryer.I went back to Richdale. “We can buy this processor for $1,500,and look what it will save us,” I told him. The financial benefits wereobvious, but Richdale was also practical. “Are you sure you can makeit work?” he asked.“Of course we can,” I assured him, even though I had no ideawhether that was true or not.The processor arrived in pieces, and it took Levy, Wolf and methe better part of a weekend to put it together. After a couple ofmissteps, we got it working. Now I not only shot and spliced thefilm, I processed it, too.At the radio station, I never had the sense that I was trying tosqueeze a quart into a pint jar. But at the television station, I feltthat way all the time. No doubt about it, it was a lot of work. I wasresponsible for creating the 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. newscasts intheir entirety. I was not on the noon broadcast, but I was expectedto contribute stories. I always had three radios on in the newsroom—the police radio, the sheriff’s radio and the state police radio.Whenever I heard something, I would jump into our Nash Ramblerstation wagon to get to the scene. Diligence paid off; in a relativelyshort period of time, we took KHOU from third place to first in theratings.Cal Jones believed that the name of the game for buildingviewership was live coverage of local news, and in Houston, therewas no bigger local news than a hurricane. Cal was from Pittsburgh,and despite his experience in TV, this was something he knewnothing about. Me, I’d been dealing with them all my life. I knew how dangerous they could be, and I already had some experiencecovering them. I was still at KTRH in 1957 when Hurricane Audreycame ashore in Louisiana, killing several hundred people. We stayedon the air all night long to cover the disaster.In September 1961, the U.S. Weather Bureau began tracking astorm system that had crossed the Yucatán from the Caribbean intothe Gulf. Even though it was still a long way off, I knew it could be aproblem. Tropical storms feed off the warm waters of the Gulf andcan quickly grow to monster size. On September 7, they named itCarla.Despite it being Labor Day weekend, I talked Cal into sending mewith a mobile unit to the nearby Galveston branch of the U.S.Weather Bureau to cover the hurricane. I wanted to go to Galvestonbecause it had one of the first WSR-57 weather surveillance radarsin the country. By nothing more than luck, Vaughn Rockney, ahurricane expert and the U.S. Weather Bureau’s chief of observation,was visiting from Washington. With his blessing we put the image ofHurricane Carla on the air. It was already huge—400 miles across,with an eye that was 50 miles in diameter.When Cal and I suggested that we superimpose the Galvestonradar image of the storm over an area map, everyone in the studioback in Houston gasped. The map instantly slammed home theenormity of the threat that Hurricane Carla posed. By letting peoplesee the mass of the storm in relation to the coastline, we inventedmodern hurricane coverage. It is commonplace now, but it hadnever been done before. On Sunday, Vaughn Rockney invoked hisauthority and ordered the evacuation of Galveston and nearby low-lying areas. About 500,000 people headed for higher ground, but mycrew and I stayed behind. We were the only news teambroadcasting live from Galveston when Carla hit.Since that time, numerous overly dramatic myths and legendshave sprung up about the coverage of Hurricane Carla, myths thatseem to have grown with each retelling. For example, Idid briefly tiemyself to a tree out in the storm. Because Carla’s winds wereprojected to reach 175 miles an hour, however, that effort wasmostly just an experiment. We gave up on it quickly. The truth was dramatic enough. As Carla made landfall, we were marooned in theGalveston weather station. At one point an engineer had to climb thetransmitter tower to restore the signal. The storm surge rose as highas the second floor (we were on the fifth); we subsisted on candybars for several days.Carla still holds the record as the most severe hurricane ever tomake landfall in the United States; severity in this case being acombination of size and intensity. In the end, however, only 46people died. Without the mandatory evacuation, it would have beenworse, much worse. Our coverage was acknowledged to beinstrumental in convincing people to flee ahead of the storm, and Iwas nicknamed “Hurricane Dan.”Shortly thereafter, I got a phone call from New York. CBS nationalwas offering me a job. I turned them down. CHAPTER 4New York, Civil Rights… and DallasAre you nuts?!”Several of my pals at KHOU, including intrepid taxi driver/fatherof seven/fly-by-night cameraman Dick Perez, thought I was crazy toreject the CBS offer. Two months later, the network came back to mewith a better deal—I was to come on board as a full correspondent,not a deskman/reporter—and I accepted.I first walked into the CBS News building at 524 West 57th Streetin Manhattan on the last day of February 1962. Before I entered, Istopped on the curb across the street, just to take in the scene. Notthat the building itself was any kind of imposing edifice—in itsformer life it had been a dairy barn. Built as the Sheffield Farmsdairy depot, until the late 1940s they were still milking cows there.I didn’t care. What I cared about was that after Bill Paley boughtit in 1952, he had converted it into TV studios, an essential step increating what many were now calling the Tiffany Network. And theTiffany Network’s crown jewel was CBS News. Standing on the curbthat February morning, I wasn’t looking at an old dairy barn. I waslooking at the cathedral of electronic journalism. With no intentwhatsoever to be sacrilegious, what the Vatican is to Catholics, theCBS News Broadcast Center was to me.I stood across the street in a swirling emotional stew that wasequal parts gratitude, humility and pride. I was keenly aware that Iwas standing on the shoulders of so many key people in my life,mentors and supporters who had propped me up and propelled me forward at crucial moments, because they loved me and believed inme: my parents; Mrs. Simmons, the principal at Love ElementarySchool; Miss Wilkerson at Reagan High School; Hugh Cunningham atSam Houston; Cal Jones at KHOU; and of course my wife, Jean.Without them, I never would have found myself here. Now I wasready to work harder than I’d ever worked before—and I knew I’dhave to. I was painfully aware that I’d have to raise my game, justto be good enough to make the grade. I was standing at the base ofMt. Everest—failure was not an option, not with a wife and two smallchildren depending on me.At the same time, I knew I’d been hired because people at CBSalready believed I was good at this. More than that, I had a feelingin my gut that I was embarking on my life’s work—the work I wasmeant to do. It wasn’t exactly a calling; it was a sense of being partof something bigger than I was. I knew that as a CBS Newscorrespondent, I would be doing important work, work thatmattered. This was the job I’d been dreaming of since I was a boystuck in bed with rheumatic fever, listening to the Murrow Boys onthe radio during the war. Two decades later, some of the “Boys,”including Charles Collingwood and Eric Sevareid, were still very muchpresent, but Murrow was no longer with the network. In 1961 JFKhad tapped Murrow to head the U.S. Information Agency. As I wasnot to learn until much later, Murrow had been having increasingproblems with network corporate brass. He was discouraged andfeeling that they no longer wanted him, and the brass encouragedthat feeling. The cabinet-level job with the Kennedy administrationwas a respectable out for him. But I didn’t know any of this at thetime.I quieted my butterflies, said a quick prayer and, not being a NewYorker, walked up half a block so I could cross at the light. It was atelltale sign, one of many, I’m sure, that loudly proclaimed that I wasnew in town. (New Yorkers, of course, are habitual jaywalkers;crossing anywhere but at the corner is common.) I entered thebuilding and went straight to Ernie Leiser’s office.Ernie Leiser was my new boss and had been largely responsiblefor hiring me. Leiser had not been one of the Murrow Boys, but he was one helluva newsman. He had written forStars and Stripesduring World War II and was among the first journalists to enterBerlin. Rumor—strictly rumor—was that he might also have beeninvolved with military intelligence. After the Hungarian Uprising of1956, Leiser had earned a Peabody Award as the first reporter tosmuggle footage out of Budapest, despite having been tossed in jailby the Communists. Now he’d made the transition from foreigncorrespondent to news executive. Hiring me was a bit of a risk forhim; if I stumbled, he was on the line for it.We chatted in his office, and the first thing he told me was that Iwas to do an on-camera audition. Screen test? Now? I’d alreadybeen hired. Usually auditions take placebefore you’re on the payroll,not after. Besides, Ernie had hours of me on tape from HurricaneCarla. What more did he need? At least I knew enough to saynothing more than, “Yes, sir.”As Ernie walked me down the hallway to Makeup, we ran intoCharles Collingwood, one of my boyhood idols. I was momentarilytongue-tied, not an ideal state for an on-air reporter.A graduate of Cornell and a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, CharlesCollingwood was easily one of the most elegant men alive. That dayhe was wearing an impeccable bespoke Savile Row suit from Kilgour,French and Stanbury that probably set him back a month of my oldsalary—at a minimum. (My suit, on the other hand, had cost about$30, tops.) He shook my hand and introduced himself. I got themarbles out of my mouth well enough to hold up my end of how-do-you-do. Collingwood himself could not have been more gracious.“Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you,” he saidwarmly. And he meant it—he went on to become yet anothermentor, and a dear friend.Charles was on his way to Makeup in preparation for reading afive-minute afternoon newsbreak. Actually, we were both headed inthe same direction. For my screen test, I was to read the samenewscast Charles had just given. This prospect left me seized not bystage fright, exactly, but by something that surely seemed closeenough to it. I felt like Ernie had just asked me to follow Horowitz atthe piano and play the same Tchaikovsky concerto. I’d never had airtime jitters like this before, but then again, it had never matteredthis much before, either.Charles introduced me to Frances Arvold. Franny was a legend inher own right. She was the first woman member of the makeupartists union in New York, and she’d had to fight her way in to getthere. Murrow himself had demanded that they let her take the test,but the good old boys in the union were determined to keep her out.They tried to rig her exam to guarantee failure. Her test was to getan actor ready in full Kabuki makeup. No problem. Franny knew herstuff—applying the flawless Kabuki whiteface, exaggerated blackbrows and deep red character lines and shadings didn’t faze her inthe slightest. Grudgingly, they had no choice but to let her in.Franny dabbed Pan-Cake on us both. Like Charles, she did herbest to put me at ease. He made sure I knew where theteleprompter would be and that I could make out the type—I didn’twear contacts back then. Collingwood read his newscast, and then Idid my audition tape immediately thereafter. I might not have read itwith as much feeling and polish as would have been ideal, but I didit flawlessly. No flubs. While I was reading, Charles stayed there inthe shadows. “Come with me,” he said after I finished. “I’ll show youaround.”The Charles Collingwood was showing me around! I guess thatmeant I passed. I was walking the corridors of CBS News with alegend, going past the doors of other legends. Within CBS News, EdMurrow and the Murrow Boys were the equivalent of King Arthur andthe Knights of the Round Table. When they began, the quality oftheir reporting and the immediacy of their voices was somethingentirely new, and it came at one of the critical times in the history ofthe world. Other networks would have other knights, but never likethose of the Round Table.On D-Day, Collingwood had come ashore on Utah Beach with aNavy underwater demolition team—on an LST laden with explosives—while the Germans were still shelling the beach. Before that, he’ddistinguished himself reporting on the North Africa campaign,culminating with the recapture of Tunis in May 1943, racking up aPeabody Award in the process. He took me past the office of Richard C. Hottelet. In Berlin in March 1941, Dick Hottelet woke to a knockon his door early on a Saturday morning. He’d been expecting aplumber but was met instead by seven members of the Gestapo. Hewas arrested for espionage, interrogated, and held as their “guest”for almost five months before being released. At first light on D-Day,Hottelet was airborne in a B-26 over Utah Beach on a bombing runto soften up German bunkers, right before the Allies swarmedashore. There’s the office of Paris bureau chief David Schoenbrun.Schoenbrun covered the invasion of southern France in 1944 andwas with the French Army when it captured Vienna, for which hewas awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Légion d’Honneur. That’sWalter Cronkite’s office. During World War II, Cronkite had been partof the “Writing 69th,” a group of journalists who flew with the EighthAir Force on raids over Germany. He’d also participated in a gliderassault with the 101st Airborne, the Screaming Eagles.Cathedral of electronic journalism indeed. It was not lost on methat I was literally surrounded by journalists who had repeatedlygone to where the news was happening—often enough at their ownperil—to get the story.Eventually Collingwood had to excuse himself; other responsibilitiesbeckoned. Before leaving he said, “Would you care to join me for adrink after work?” I told him I’d be honored. I stayed in the buildinglong enough to say good night to Ernie Leiser and to watch DouglasEdwards do theEvening News, which was only 15 minutes long atthe time. I met up with Charles at a place across the street, asomewhat notorious newsmen’s hangout called the Slate. Of coursehe drank Scotch.We were joined by Doug Edwards and Don Hewitt. Edwards hadanchored theEvening News since the fledgling days of television,beginning in 1948. During the war, he had been a latecomer toMurrow’s team, but was nevertheless a valued member. I had grownup with him on radio and television, and I respected and admiredhim. He was a pro and, as I learned after I came to CBS News, agenuinely good person. In his trademark plaid jackets, Don Hewitt might have beenmistaken for a horse tout. Having started as a copyboy for theNewYork Herald Tribune, he was now the producer of theEvening News.A year and a half earlier, Hewitt had directed the pivotal Nixon-Kennedy presidential debate, the one in which Nixon’s refusal to letFranny Arvold apply TV makeup on him did much to put JohnKennedy in the White House. That September 1960 televised debateis arguably the beginning of a heady 15-year period during which TVliterally changed the course of American history.Next morning I shined my new Florsheim wingtips and headed formy first real day on the job. I arrived early and was issued acubbyhole office, about the size of a broom closet, and a fly swatter.Being from Texas, I didn’t give the swatter a second thought, but itturned out to be more valuable than I’d anticipated. From time totime, echoes of the building’s dairy past resurfaced, which is to saythat periodically we would be besieged by huge infestations of flies.Because there had been cows in the building for such a long time,thousands of fly colonies had formed. For many years the fliesresisted all efforts to get rid of them completely.The flies were not the only echoes. The CBS News BroadcastCenter was perched atop a labyrinthine warren of burrows andcatacombs dating from the Roaring Twenties that extended all theway to the Hudson. During Prohibition, bootleggers and smugglersbrought barges of whiskey up the river, then off-loaded their illicitcargo onto the banks and into the tunnels that led to the dairy. Oncein the dairy, the whiskey was transferred into milk cans—the perfectcamouflage—and then delivered to speakeasies all over town. AfterProhibition ended, however, the passageways were never sealed off.Rats found their way into the labyrinth, and occasionally they foundtheir way into CBS News. Years later, Eric Ober was president duringa particularly heavy rat invasion. These were nasty, snarly XXL NewYork City river rats, big enough to mate with a possum. We hadotherwise sophisticated women standing on chairs and screaming atthe very sight of them, but corporate seemed a little slow to graspthe magnitude of the problem. It was only half in jest that Ithreatened to get an ocelot to keep in my office—which would be the down-home Texas solution to any rat problem—but at that pointOber called in the exterminators.As I first settled in, Ernie Leiser told me I’d be in my cubbyholefor about six months. Management wanted me to get comfortablewith the CBS way of doing things. It wasn’t more than six weekslater, however, that I started getting the feeling that I was spinningmy wheels. I wasn’t nearly busy enough. I was used to going outdaily and reporting from the field; now I was going stir-crazy.Ernie’s solution was not at all what I expected: He sent me backto Texas.I’d hoped to be assigned to London, Paris or Berlin, but what CBSneeded at the moment was more domestic beachheads in our majorcities. I tried not to look crestfallen, but Ernie assured me this wouldbe a great opportunity for me. My territory was huge: 23 states(including the most hurricane-prone ones along the Gulf), Mexicoand Central America. Still, I was going back to Texas. When I toldJean, she was as pleased as I was disappointed—and then some.I knew nothing about setting up a bureau, but I went to Dallasand started looking at office space. After I found a spot, I contactedthe CBS real estate division and they gave me the go-ahead to signthe lease. I was now the Dallas bureau chief; chief of a bureau ofone. When I found a story that I felt was worthy of being on theEvening News, I was to call a freelance cameraman who lived inManhattan, Kansas—Wendell Hoffman.Wendell was a 6 foot 4 inch lanky farm boy who had landed onthe beaches of Normandy on D-Day. A graduate of the University ofNebraska, he was something of a Renaissance man, much moreJimmy Stewart than country bumpkin. He was also gutsy and verycreative about finding ways to get a story. Five years earlier, Wendellhad accompanied CBS producer Robert Taber to Cuba. The wildcover story they invented to mislead the regime of militarystrongman Fulgencio Batista was that they were Presbyterianclergymen traveling across the island to survey their missionaryschools. After leaving Havana, however, Hoffman loaded his bulkyAuricon camera, batteries and film onto a mule for the harrowing600-mile five-day trek into the wildest reaches of the Sierra Maestra mountains. They went in search of some local troublemakers;whether they were bandits or revolutionaries depended on yourpoint of view.They found them, then spent several days filming andinterviewing the dynamic leader and his ragtag band of followers. Onthe way back to Havana, Wendell buried his camera and batteries inthe roadside brush to make it easier to smuggle his film back out ofthe country. That footage becameThe Rebels of Sierra Maestra—Cuba’s Jungle Fighters, a CBS documentary that aired on May 19,1957. The program gave U.S. viewers one of their first glimpses of avery young Fidel Castro and instantly gave lie to Batista’s assertionthat the Castro-led insurgency was a myth. Less than two yearslater, Castro ousted Batista and at age 32 became Cuba’s primeminister.Wendell was obviously another guy who’d pursue a storywherever it led him. He and I hit it off right away. He saw me forwhat I was: eager, ambitious, hardworking, kind of raw, but withpotential. Not only did he help me look for stories, he also helpedme hone my writing and my on-air presentation. “The biggestdifference between where you are and where you want to be,” hetold me in his high-pitched nasal twang, “is the quality of yourwriting.“I’ve been shooting film sinceMovietone News,” he continued. “Ican get us the pictures we need, but your writing is key to telling thestory. Occasionally you have to write under pressure, but more oftenyou have enough time to really craft a script. Use it. Think aboutopening lines, closing lines.” That struck a chord with me, because inthe brief time I was in New York, I’d looked at scripts. I wasimpressed by the beautiful scripts of Charles Kuralt, the youngestCBS News correspondent ever hired. Collingwood, of course, wroteas elegantly as he did everything else.Wendell and I would trade story ideas back and forth. He wasone of the savviest people I’d ever met on the subject of race, andon the importance of race in the American saga. It was WendellHoffman who first suggested to me that we should be following Dr.Martin Luther King. In the summer of 1962 we went to Albany, Georgia, to coverwhat was called the “Albany Movement,” one of the earliestsustained desegregation campaigns. Wendell and I arrived to takeover for Atlanta bureau chief Hughes Rudd, who’d already been onthe story for several weeks and had earned a break.Albany was a crash course in battlefield journalism acquired onthe fly. The most valuable lessons involved how to operate in anintense, hostile environment. I learned quickly—I had to. Put simply,we weren’t wanted there, and everyone let us know we weren’twanted there. No matter where we went, we stuck out. Because weobviously were “not from here,” I made it a point to look professional—dark suit, dark socks, trousers creased, shoes shined, white shirt,black silk tie à la James Bond. I wanted it to be readily apparent thatI was a reporter and that I represented CBS News, the mostdistinguished and honored news organization in the country. I alsoupped the “yes ma’am/no ma’am; yes sir/no sir” content of myspeech. That ritualized politeness was something every child learnedin the South; it certainly had been thoroughly drummed into me as aboy. Wendell Hoffman thought I risked appearing too deferential, butin Albany, Georgia, it became the grease I relied on to slide throughtouchy situations when we found ourselves surrounded by angrywhite crowds. “I’m not being obsequious, Wendell,” I told him. “I’mtrying to get this job done and stay alive.”I’d been asked by Ernie Leiser to get as close to Dr. King aspossible, and it was here in Albany that I met him for the first time. Iwas instantly impressed. As the center of the storm, he wasgrounded, secure in the knowledge that his cause was just. He wasalways thinking beyond that moment, that hour, that day, plottingout what the movement’s next steps should be. No matter howmuch chaos swirled around him, Dr. King exuded an aura of calm.He also had tremendous focus, a precious ability to make you feellike you were the only person in the room. Overall he had a quality Icame to know as “peace at the center,” and I among many othersrespected him greatly for it.His main adversary in town was the Albany police chief, LauriePritchett. Pritchett was wily enough to cloak his efforts to foil the protesters in the guise of maintaining public order. Dodging andweaving, he deftly avoided direct confrontation with Dr. King himself.King’s efforts in Albany resulted in a standoff at best. In Dr. King’sown assessment, “We got nothing.” Nevertheless, I came awaybelieving that the civil rights movement was on the verge of gainingtraction and really gathering momentum. I told Ernie Leiser what Ithought. “Get all over it,” he told me. Leiser saw it not only as animportant story, but also as a potential coup for the News Division;CBS had been the only national TV network reporting the story fromAlbany. By this time, Walter Cronkite had replaced Doug Edwards inthe anchor chair for theEvening News; with expanded civil rightscoverage, Ernie saw an opportunity to gain some ground on NBC,which at the time was on top of the ratings with Chet Huntley andDavid Brinkley. At my suggestion and urged on by Wendell Hoffman,we started crisscrossing the South in search of civil rights stories,covering protests and head-knockings in tank towns and backwaterplaces like Yazoo City, Mississippi, and Plaquemines Parish,Louisiana.Looking back, I was almost spectacularly unqualified to becovering what I was covering. As I was growing up, the HeightsAnnex was a segregated society, as was Houston, as was Texas, aswas the rest of the South. As was, frankly, the rest of the country.Race, however, was not a topic we shied away from at home. Iremember my parents discussing the 1936 Olympics. Held in Berlin,these were the so-called Nazi Olympics. Hitler had elaborately stagedthem to showcase the physical superiority of the Aryan master race,but the real Superman of the Games was a black American track starnamed Jesse Owens. To the chagrin of the Third Reich, Owensearned four gold medals in Berlin, more than any other athlete.Upon his return to the States, Owens was given a ticker-tapeparade up Fifth Avenue. When the parade ended, however, he wasobliged to ride the freight elevator at the Waldorf-Astoria to thereception in his honor. At the time, African Americans were called“Negroes” in polite parlance; sadly, polite parlance was often hard tocome by. “Nigger” and other derogatory epithets were at least as common and were uttered openly and without shame. Racism wasn’tjust common; it was the norm.My parents were by no means integration activists, but they didhave a sense of decency about how folks—of any race—should betreated. As a teenager, I had accompanied my father to a localDemocratic Party precinct meeting to elect a slate of delegates tothe county convention. It surely sounds odd today, but back thenthere were virtually no Republicans in Texas. The scars from the CivilWar ran long and deep; being nominated as a Democrat was prettymuch the same thing as being elected. My mother had sent mealong to ride shotgun, as it were, because she thought there mightbe trouble. Her instincts were correct. Some black veterans newlyreturned from the war showed up, expecting to participate fully inthe meeting, which was their right. As had been prearranged,however, the white men used to running things had already chosenan all-white slate of delegates. In essence, the fix was in—votingwas a mere formality. Though they were few in number, the blackvets loudly objected to the sham. When the chairman called for avote, saying, “All those opposed to the nominations, stand,” theblack vets all stood up. My father rose to his feet with them.The chairman gave my father a chance to back down, suggestingthat perhaps he’d stood up at the wrong time. My father stood hisground, a trait that seems to go far back in the Rather DNA. Hemade it clear that there had been no mistake; he was siding with theveterans. The rest of the white men—men he’d known for years—looked at him as if he were Judas himself. I understood why mymother had asked me to go along. Things got testy at that point, butafter some rough jostling and some name-calling, the meetingended.My father was very proud when I got the job with CBS in NewYork, but he did not live long enough to see me do much reporting.In May 1962, less than two months after I began at the network, a16-year-old boy lost control of the concrete truck he was driving.Dad was on his way to work when the truck crossed the centerlineand hit his car head-on. He died instantly. I think it was Uncle Johnwho reached me in Dallas. I immediately asked how my father was, and Uncle John answered, “He has passed.” My first reaction wasdisbelief: “How could this be?” I went into a deep depression andmade immediate plans to fly to Houston to be with my mother. Noneof us could have expected this. I was touched that the men whoworked on the pipeline with my father kept a vigil. They stayed thenight with my father’s casket. There could be no doubt of thenobility and decency of those laborers. All of us in the family weredevastated, and it was especially devastating to me when my mothersaid through her tears: “You are the leader of the family now.” Myfather’s death affected me for a long time thereafter. For manyyears, I thought that I would die at the age my father died: 52 yearsold. I don’t think my mother ever got over it. She died six years later,in 1968.The Texas I grew up in was a segregated society, but Texas was notlike Georgia or Alabama or Mississippi. Growing up, I had never seena cross burned on anybody’s lawn, or a Klan meeting. My first directexposure to the Klan happened in south Georgia. Conventionaljournalistic wisdom of the time had it that covering Klan rallieswasn’t worth the trouble. The Klan, it was said, had been thoroughlyinfiltrated by the FBI.I wanted to see for myself. As soon as we pulled up, I knew thatconventional wisdom had it all wrong—this rally was much too big.They couldn’t all be informants.Up until then I’d considered Klansmen as something cartoonish,almost humorous in their white satin hooded costumes. To me theywere an anachronism, a bizarre remnant left over from a bygoneera. Seeing them in person changed all that in a heartbeat. It was asurreal experience, absolutely revolting and repellent, but alsomesmerizing. And, I realized, potentially very scary.There were upward of 200 people there, and yes, they were all inhoods. An involuntary shiver went down my spine. Seeing them inperson gave me an instant deeper understanding of the terror thatthe Klan represented. For this shoot, Wendell had picked up a local soundman named Leroy. “Is this dangerous?” I asked him as weparked.“Make no mistake,” Leroy replied in his honeyed Georgia drawl.“These sum’ bitcheswill kill you. Theywant to kill you, and they’ll doit with great joy and happiness.”We were warned as soon as we got out of the car to get the hellout and don’t you dare film anything. Behind the hoods, the eyesflashed nothing but hostility, and I immediately realized that Leroywas right. “If I had just a second alone with you in the dark,” thoseeyes seemed to say, “I would cut out your heart and throw your liverto the dogs.”Soon we were surrounded by a menacing circle of hoodedKlansmen. They bumped us and put their hands over the camera.They began murmuring, and then the shoving got stronger. Weformed a wedge to break free of the circle. After that we stayedabout 15 minutes on the outer edges of the rally before I gaveWendell the hand signal to get out. Although we actually did manageto shoot some footage clandestinely, there wasn’t enough to make adecent segment for air.We weren’t beat up that night, but there was a real risk of it. Bylate September 1962 in Oxford, Mississippi, however, the stakeswere much higher, and the risk was a lot more serious than justgetting beat up. Wendell and I had headed for Oxford becauseJames Meredith was about to enroll as the first black student at OleMiss. Attorney General Robert Kennedy had deployed a phalanx ofU.S. Marshals to ensure his matriculation. The entire city of Oxfordwas on edge. In anticipation of the confrontation, the town wasswollen with outsiders, not just reporters but a lot of diehard sons ofthe old South, bent on stemming the tide of integration at any cost.In short, they were out for blood.They got it. We had expected trouble; we just badlyunderestimated how much. What started as an Ole Miss football-style pep rally quickly turned ugly. Fifteen hours of rioting followed.Wendell and I had been joined by Laurens Pierce, another CBSphotojournalist, and by my Houston friend Dick Perez, the erstwhilecabbie. Dick had simply shown up one day—unannounced and unpaid—to pitch in with civil rights coverage. In Oxford I was payinghim out of my own pocket, but he was worth every penny, and I wasvery glad he was there.Despite being on an American college campus, there was nodoubt that we were in a war zone. Once it got dark, every time weturned on our battery-powered lighting, we made ourselves a target.Bullets flew in our direction. We spent much of that night crawlingon our stomachs, alligator style, from one vantage point to another,trying to get good footage while under fire.That was the difference between us and someone like ClaudeSitton, who won a Pulitzer covering the civil rights movement for theNew York Times. When we traveled on assignment, our cumbersomeequipment made it virtually impossible to maintain a low profile.Because Claude traveled solo and carried little more than a reporter’snotebook, he could pretty much blend in.The first fatality on campus that night was French journalist PaulGuihard. Tragically, his last dispatch that day had been even truerthan he knew: “The Civil War has never ended.” Guihard was shot atpoint-blank range—in the back. I’d been speaking with him minutesbefore; he and I were the same age. There was one other death, alocal white resident who’d come to the campus out of curiosity andwas shot execution style, between the eyes. Countless more wereinjured. The next morning, spent shell casings littered the walkways.The problem was much bigger than the small group of marshalscould handle. It took 3,000 federal troops in full riot gear to restoreorder.I had come of age during the earliest stages of the cold war. AfterWorld War II and throughout the 1950s, we all took it as a giventhat the greatest potential threat to our country was coming fromthe Left, in particular from the Communist bloc. Castro’s takeover ofCuba, of course, reinforced that belief. My first indication that therecould be a threat from the Right—especially the Right within ourown country—took place while I was still in Houston. While at KHOU,I tried and failed to get an interview with John Birch Society founderRobert Welch—and was reviled by him as a Bolshevik for my efforts.The right-wing riot at Oxford was further proof that threats could come from the extreme fringes of both sides of the politicalspectrum.Most of the civil rights news at that time was coming from whatwe think of as the Deep South—Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia andSouth Carolina—none of them particularly convenient to the Dallasbureau, or to home. Jean and I had chosen a place on the outskirtsof the city, halfway to Fort Worth. I was on the road a lot,sometimes coming home for little more than a catnap, a shower, anda change of clothes. Worse yet, often enough when I did comehome, I was not alone. I’d have Wendell with me; we’d put him upin the guest bedroom before we set off again. Wendell and I wouldarrive with all his gear in a beat-up station wagon. Its suspensionwas pretty much gone, so the jarring metallic scrape of the tailpipebottoming out on the pavement heralded our arrival and departureto the neighborhood. When we arrived at 2:00 a.m. and left beforedawn, as was often the case, we set local tongues to wagging: “Whothe hell are these people? The husband comes and goes in themiddle of the night with that strange man in that huge stationwagon dragging on the ground and who knows what’s in there?They must be part of a crime syndicate. Mafia, obviously.” And ofcourse Jean was the one who had to deal with it, not me.As tough as covering civil rights was on the home front, it waseven tougher in the trenches. Above and beyond the dangers andproblems of being on assignment, which were indeed considerable,we were having a lot of trouble getting our civil rights footage backto headquarters. We were repeatedly getting bushwhacked by ourown affiliates. After we shot our piece, we generally took it to theclosest local CBS affiliate; they were supposed to process it and sendit to New York. Time after time, however, we found that our ownlocal stations wouldn’t cooperate. For many of them, CBS hadbecome either the Colored Broadcasting System or the CommunistBroadcasting System, or an unholy amalgam of both. “By giving somuch airtime to those black agitators, those niggers, you’re helpingthe Communists. We don’t want anything to do with you” was apretty fair summation of what we often heard. What finally tore it was an experience in Jackson, Mississippi.Wendell and I brought in some film to be processed. We were ondeadline. We waited and waited. Finally someone came out and said,“Unfortunately, we had a malfunction in the processor. All your filmwas ruined. So sorry.” He didn’t make even a token effort to soundsincere.I got on the phone with Ernie Leiser. Noncooperation from theaffiliates was bad enough; deliberate sabotage was another matterentirely. “This is well past the point of acceptability,” I told him.Ernie immediately went into problem-solving mode. “We need toget you a more convenient home base, and a place where you knowyou can get your film processed,” he told me. “What about NewOrleans?” New Orleans was the home of station WWL, which wasowned by the Jesuits of Loyola University. Because WWL was veryprofitable for them, they wanted very much to keep their CBSaffiliation, which meant they were willing to commit to processingour film and sending it on to New York.“But we just got here!” Jean exclaimed when I told her that wewould be moving from Dallas to the Big Easy. While Wendell and Iwere on assignment, she visited New Orleans to check it out. Shefound it strange and exotic, a good thing if you’re on holiday, less soif you’re trying to raise two young children pretty much single-handed. “I just can’t do this,” she told me when I returned home. “IfI move there, I won’t know a soul. You’re on the road all the time,and I’ll have no support system. I think it’s better if I take the kidsback to Houston.”“But we’re married,” I said. “That’s not the way married peoplelive.”“The way we livenow is not the way married people live,” sheresponded sharply.Jean’s arrow found its mark; there was nothing I could say.Looking at my calendar for 1962 and 1963, I was home for 31 daysone year and 43 the next. I had become an absentee father and anabsentee husband. One year I barely remembered to call Jean onher birthday. I think I dialed the number just a couple of minutesbefore midnight, and it did not help matters that I was calling from the newly opened Playboy Club in New Orleans. Not surprisingly,things were a little frosty in the Rather household for some timethereafter.Even though I had to acknowledge the stress my schedule wasplacing on our family life, being home more and not working as hardwasn’t really an option. Jean did extract a promise from me to makecertain that what time I did spend at home was quality time. Ipromised to be genuinely present—physically, mentally andemotionally—for her and for the children when I was home, and it’sa promise I have tried very hard to keep. When we moved thebureau to New Orleans, she packed up the house in Dallas andfound a place in Houston near my mother and her parents.Our civil rights reporting provoked a firestorm of responses, andthe complaints went all the way to the top. CEO William Paley had tocontend with irate southern senators who threatened our broadcastlicenses, but in dealing with Washington, network president FrankStanton was our ace in the hole. Stanton was very close to VicePresident Lyndon Johnson. Many decades earlier, Stanton had putLBJ, at the time a raw young congressman, into the radio businessand then into the television business. For several years, Johnson’stelevision station was the only one on the air in Austin. It had a lockon the market because Stanton had showed Johnson the ropes withthe FCC. As those media businesses boomed, they became thefoundation of Johnson’s personal fortune. Meanwhile, LBJ rose upthe DC food chain. Before being tapped as Kennedy’s vice president,Johnson had become arguably the most effective Senate majorityleader in history. Now as VP, he still wielded enormous power andinfluence in the Senate, and behind the scenes was able toeffectively neutralize the threats against CBS.In addition to causing political problems, civil rights coverage wasalso a potential drain on the CBS bottom line. Companies that did alot of business in the South were skittish about sponsoring anythingthat smacked of unrest or racial conflict. They warned the networkthat they might pull their advertising, and some made good on theirthreat. For a time, our own Atlanta affiliate made peace with itsadvertisers by refusing to air some of theEvening News, in order to avoid showing footage of sit-ins and other protests. Other affiliatesthreatened to jump ship and leave the network entirely.Naturally this did not sit well with Paley, who believed in theintegrity of the news. Despite the political problems and the threatsof boycott, his commitment—and hence that of the network—toreporting on the civil rights movement never wavered. The news andits “public information service,” as he saw it, are “necessary to thepeople of a democratic nation who are faced with the need to beinformed on all important issues.” Paley understood that bypresenting the news seriously and honestly, CBS was fulfilling amajor obligation that was part of its public trust. Besides, by anyyardstick, the civil rights movement had now become a story thatwas too big to ignore.Paley had the guts to back up his beliefs and now moved swiftlyto deal with the insurrection among the affiliates. At his direction,Frank Stanton played hardball with the Atlanta station owner. Hedelivered an ultimatum: If he chose to continue to black out orcensor the national newscast, he would find himself adrift without anetwork. Stanton would pull the plug and sign up a different localstation as the CBS affiliate. What gave the threat real financial teethwas that CBS was the leading station in the Atlanta market. OnceAtlanta agreed to air theEvening News uncut, their capitulation hadthe desired deterrent effect on the others.Paley also received mailbags full of vitriolic letters written byangry viewers. There were allegations that we were taking the sideof the black community, that we were all pink-tinged fellow travelersfrom New York and knew nothing of the South, and that I myselfwas a rabid Marxist revolutionary, just like Robert Welch had said Iwas. Back in Houston, a few people Jean would run into took itpersonally. Jean was put on the defensive for what I was reporting.“What the hell is your husband doing, giving free publicity to thoseniggers and riling up all those Yankees, just so they can come downhere to cause trouble? And why is he lionizing that Communist,Martin Luther King?”When I came home, Jean and I would talk about it. She’d ask mewhat Dr. King was like, and I’d tell her as best I could. Dr. King and I were cordial, but we maintained a carefully defined separation. Thatsaid, he always knew how to reach me if he needed tocommunicate. My code name for him was “Volunteer,” and therewere a few times when I received a message from a hotel clerksaying, “Mr. Volunteer called.” I was closer to Medgar Evers, and ourrelationship was much less formal than the one I maintained with Dr.King. I considered Medgar a friend, and he eventually became oneof my principal sources within the civil rights movement. I wentplaces with him where most black people wouldn’t set foot. Iaccompanied him to the polls to vote, and Wendell’s camera wasrolling when Medgar was told flat out that he could not cast a ballot—which was, of course, flagrantly against the law.That image and so many others prompted people across thecountry to begin examining their own beliefs about desegregationand the civil rights movement. Television was hugely instrumental inchanging public opinion, and with it the course of American history.It certainly was a vivid part of my evaluation of my own beliefs.Covering the civil rights movement was the making of me, both as ajournalist and as a human being.It was by extension the making of Jean as well, because she hadto take care of the kids and run the home and defend what I wasdoing. It was a Herculean performance on her part. In a way, itprepared her for Watergate a decade later. With all the time I wasaway from home, I was relieved to know that Jean and the childrenwere safe in Houston. Throughout the South during this period,there was open hostility not just toward blacks, but toward the pressas well.I have always felt a strong sense of responsibility for my crew.Whenever I picked up an extra cameraman, soundman or lightingman for a civil rights assignment, I was mindful that I was bringinghim into harm’s way. This was true even if he was from the localcommunity. Some, like Leroy, the soundman who accompanied us tothe Klan rally, were fully aware of the dangers, but others were not.One cameraman was pursued through town by thugs armed withwickedly sharp sawed-off pool cues. Realizing that these hooligansreally meant to do him harm, he took refuge in a men’s store. He tried to disappear into the inventory, suspending himself by his armsamong the suits on the rack. The experience precipitated a coronarythat left him incapacitated for several months.When we were covering a story, I was on edge, all day, everyday. Every sinew in my body was tight. Only when we were finallyairborne on the way out of town did I feel like I could exhale.Fatigue started being a factor, however, and I began the habit ofchecking into a hotel, sometimes even during the day. Not everyhotel would accept reporters, and even those that did weren’texactly warm and welcoming. We often had trouble getting servedbreakfast in the hotel dining room. We’d sit there for a half hour andbe deliberately ignored.If a situation looked particularly dicey, we would sleep in shifts.Wendell and I would sleep while the soundman kept watch. Then I’dget up and the soundman would bed down. I didn’t wake Wendell; itwas always more important for the cameraman to get more shut-eye. In these situations, the camera and the footage were far moreimportant than the correspondent. Sometimes each of us would taketurns sleeping in the car. There were a few places where I wasworried enough to send the housekeeper downstairs with $20 totake another room in her own name—and that would be the roomeach of us would sleep in. Late at night, in case the wrong peoplecame looking for you, you didn’t want to be where they thought youwere.We developed standard tactics to protect ourselves while filming,including hand signals. I was like a baseball coach, flashing signsfrom third base. The cameraman was most at risk; with his eyeglued to the eyepiece, he was pretty much blind. This meant thatthe correspondent was always to his right and shoulder-to-shoulderwith him. The soundman stuck to the cameraman’s left shoulder andwas responsible for protecting our left flank, as well as for watchingthe rear. Often enough we’d bring a lighting man with us, notnecessarily because we needed one, but because we could use theextra set of eyes.Because we were doing more civil rights coverage than the othernetworks, CBS, and by extension me and my crew, became a particular lightning rod. The phrase I heard most often from localcitizens at this time was “We don’t want trouble.” But as they saw it,trouble seemed to arrive hand in hand with CBS News. We werepulling back the scab on a long-festering sore and putting it on TVevery night. NBC and ABC were doing some coverage but not asmuch as we were, for reasons that are not clear to me.We were threatened all the time. In one instance, we had justlanded at an airport in Alabama and were at the rental car counterdebating what model to select. The optimal vehicle was somethingbig enough to hold all the gear but also nondescript—grey or black,never red or green. Off to the side, not spoken to me directly, but ina deliberately audible stage whisper, I heard, “It doesn’t make anydifference what kind of car he gets. We’re gonna blow it up anyway.”It turned out to be an empty bluff, but I will go to my gravebelieving that some of my problems with what is commonly calledthe Right and the Hard Right started during this time. In my opinion,the malice that began during the civil rights movement was carriedforward to Watergate, and then again to the coverage of GeorgeBush and the Air National Guard.I struggled to remain an honest broker of information, and wherepossible to report both sides of the story. Now, however, I sawbrutality on a daily basis, and it was a shock from the verybeginning. There certainly had been institutionalized racism in theHouston I grew up in; everything from movie theaters to waterfountains to football teams was segregated. What I saw now,however, was much more than just racial prejudice. It was hate, andhate with an intensity and a virulence I’d never seen before. I sawnot just Klan rallies but cross burnings, and people beating womenand children. Time after time I said to myself, “I can’t believe whatI’m seeing, but I’m here to be an eyewitness, and to make thecamera a witness.”None of the violence I’d seen to date prepared me for what tookplace next. Dr. King and his supporters had learned a lot from whathappened—and did not happen—in Albany a year earlier. Albany hadbeen the Petri dish. They realized that they could march and chantand sing till hell froze over, but it wouldn’t make a dent unless they elicited an extreme response from the segregationists and the presswas there to witness it, report it and show it on the air.The civil rights movement needed to get America’s attention in adramatic fashion. They needed to get their story out—visually. Andperhaps most of all, they needed to find a police chief who was sofilled with racial hatred and was such a dumbass that he didn’t carewhat the pictures looked like.Welcome to Birmingham, Alabama.Birmingham was by consensus the most segregated city in theSouth, and its white leadership wore that title as a badge of honor.In April 1963, when the Southern Christian Leadership Conferencelaunched the Birmingham campaign, an important component wasProject C. The “C” stood for “Confrontation.” The plan was to protestsegregation through sit-ins, kneel-ins, economic boycotts and othernonviolent actions, all concentrated in Birmingham’s central businessdistrict, in hopes of sparking an overreaction from the authorities.The movement found the perfect foil in Bull Connor, Birmingham’scommissioner of public safety. Connor was already notorious for hisrabid segregationist views and harsh tactics. In 1961, he hadallowed KKK thugs to viciously beat a group of Freedom Ridersarriving in town on a Greyhound bus. To give the Klan enough timeto really inflict injury, he intentionally waited 15 minutes beforesending in his officers to intervene. A year later, he closed down 60city parks rather than comply with a court-mandated desegregationorder.Now in the spring of 1963, Connor responded to thedemonstrations the way Dr. King expected he would and beganarresting protesters in downtown Birmingham. King himself wasarrested on Good Friday, April 12, and placed in solitaryconfinement. While there, he wrote his eloquent manifesto “Letterfrom Birmingham Jail.” “For years now I have heard the word ‘Wait!’” he wrote. “It rings in the ear of every Negro with a piercingfamiliarity. This ‘wait’ has almost always meant ‘never’…“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” hecontinued. “We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality,tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” Scribbled on toilet paper and in the margins ofpages from the phone book, the letter was smuggled out. Excerptssoon began appearing in newspapers and journals across thecountry.On May 2, organizers launched a second phase of the campaign,a controversial tactic that came to be known as the Children’sCrusade. For the first time, the movement was deliberately puttingkids aged 6 to 18 on the front lines. Like their parents, waves ofchildren—kindergarteners and high schoolers alike—left the parkacross from the 16th Street Baptist Church, arm in arm and singing“We Shall Overcome.” And like their elders, they, too, were thrown injail. That day the Birmingham Police Department arrested almost athousand children in a single three-hour period, overwhelming thecity’s justice system and filling the jails to overflowing.Bull Connor was nothing if not predictable. The next day, whenmore children gathered at the park and started marching, heordered the fire department to turn its high-pressure hoses on them.Up close, the jets of water would be forceful enough to flay fleshfrom bone; even at a somewhat greater distance, the water rippedclothing and sent children rolling down the street. Connor also setpolice dogs on protesters trying to take refuge in the 16th StreetBaptist Church. Cameraman Laurens Pierce got it all on film for ourreporting team.Birmingham was the tipping point. Until Birmingham, we weremired in a sort of national denial. Even urban blacks in the Northwere unaware of how extreme conditions were in the South. No onewanted to acknowledge that things were as bad as they were, thatseparate-but-equal had always been a fraud, and that every daypeaceful protesters were getting jailed and savagely beaten by thepolice and by white supremacists for doing nothing more thaninsisting on their civil rights and basic human dignity.Now, however, TV cameras captured the brutal reality of it in away that even the best newspaper reporting could not. The eyes ofthe entire country were now on Birmingham, because televisionmade it impossible to look away. King and other leaders of the movement kept up thedemonstrations for another week. Business came to a standstill.Finally on May 10, both the city and the chamber of commerce hadhad enough. King announced an agreement to desegregate majorpublic facilities, lunch counters and store dressing rooms. As of May11, Bull Connor was out of a job.This was another crucial moment in which television changed thecourse of our nation’s history. Andrew Young, who would eventuallybecome the mayor of Atlanta, told me directly that without TV, thecivil rights movement might never have been as successful as soonas it was.A month after Birmingham, Alabama governor George Wallacemade his “Stand in the Schoolhouse Door,” an attention-gettingpublicity stunt to block registration of black students at theUniversity of Alabama. We were in Tuscaloosa covering that eventwhen I got the call. Medgar Evers, my friend, had been shot todeath on the steps to his front porch—shot in the back, in full viewof his family. I and my crew quickly chartered a plane to Jackson,Mississippi, and got to the scene before any other members of thepress arrived.This was one of the instances when I did get a message from Mr.Volunteer. Dr. King wanted to know if the police had been involved inthe assassination. There were no obvious signs that they had been,but at the time it was impossible to say one way or the other. I wasthe first to break the news of Evers’s death. Less than six monthslater, I would be the first to break the news of another politicalassassination.When it was announced that President Kennedy was to come toTexas in November 1963, I was assigned to coordinate CBS’scoverage of the trip, because I knew Texas and because I hadcovered the Dallas desk. It was to be an all-hands-on-deckoperation. Robert Pierpoint, our White House correspondent, wouldof course be traveling with the president. In addition, we brought innot just our crew from New Orleans, including reporters Lew Wood and Nelson Benton and cameramen Wendell Hoffman and DickPerez, but camera crews and correspondents from all over thecountry. I was to be the field marshal, making assignments of whocovered which venues and which events. Once I’d done that, mymajor duties were completed. There was never any expectation thatI’d be on the air much, if at all.This particular visit was seen as the unofficial kickoff to Kennedy’sreelection campaign. Even though Texas was Lyndon Johnson’shome state and still heavily Democratic, Kennedy had carried it in1960 by a scant 2 percent. Now gearing up for 1964, JFK wanted toget to Texas early on, both to raise money and to make nice with allthe local political powers, Governor John Connally in particular.On the morning of November 22, 1963, Air Force One landed atLove Field. Because Kennedy was in campaign mode, once it wasdetermined that the weather would cooperate, the bubble canopy ofthe presidential limousine was removed. Crowds in downtown Dallas,hoping for a glimpse of the president and first lady, lined the routeto the Trade Mart, where JFK was to give a speech. In themotorcade, Governor Connally and his wife were riding with theKennedys. Vice President Johnson was in another limousine, severalcars behind. Following the president’s Lincoln convertible was a truckcarrying photographers from the various news services, including ourown. At intervals along the motorcade route, I had stationedindividuals holding bright yellow grapefruit bags. The bags werelightweight and distinctive; without screaming “CBS News,” theywere easy to spot. Our cameramen in the truck would toss their filmcans to the grapefruit bag holders, who would then rush the footageback to KRLD, our Dallas affiliate, for processing.I positioned myself at the last drop-off position, grapefruit bag inhand. I was just on the other side of what we have all come to knowas the grassy knoll. I didn’t hear a shot; I didn’t witness the actualevent. I was waiting for the motorcade when a squad car sped pastme, followed in short order by the president’s limousine, flying by attop speed. I didn’t see the president in the car, and the camera truckwas nowhere to be seen. I knew something was wrong, very wrong,but I didn’t know exactly what had happened. As I hightailed it back to KRLD, I sprinted past a scene ofincredible chaos: people on the ground, fathers lying on top of theirchildren, shielding them from some unseen but lethal danger. WhenI got to the station, the UPI wire was already reporting that shotshad been fired and that the president had been wounded, perhapsseriously.All my old instincts as a police reporter kicked in. I knew that ifanyone had gotten hit, he or she would be taken to ParklandHospital. I also knew that the phone lines into the hospital would getjammed up pretty quickly. I immediately started calling Parkland. Igot a busy signal the first time but then got through to theswitchboard operator. “Don’t hang up on me,” I said, “I’m a reporter.Is there anyone I can talk to?” She patched me through to a doctor.I identified myself and asked what had happened. “The presidenthas been killed,” he told me before clicking off. I redialed thehospital and again reached the switchboard. The operator was bynow much put-upon, but she connected me with a priest.“Father, I’m Dan Rather with CBS News, and I’m trying to confirmwhether the president has been shot.”“Yes,” he replied. “The president has been shot and he is dead.”This was a hammer to the heart. Once I knew that the presidentwas dead—and it happened in nanoseconds—I had the same gut-wrenching emotional reaction, the same sense of shock and disbeliefthat everyone else in America had. At the moment, however, I hadto push that feeling aside. I couldn’t give in to it, not then, and as itturned out, not for many days. To be able to continue to do my job,I had to check the flood of emotion before it overwhelmed me. Itwas a very conscious and deliberate choice, much like a doctor ormedic must make, and in times such as these, it is absolutelynecessary. Whether by instinct or by training, this is where steelyprofessionalism has to kick in. You must become single-minded andfocused on the work at hand. “I don’t have time for any of thatnow,” I told myself. “I’ll grieve—later. Right now people aredepending on me to take care of the story.” It’s something I’vealways been able to do. Years later, the same habit kicked in duringour marathon coverage of 9/11. The question now was what to do with the terrible knowledge Ipossessed. There had been no official announcement, but I had adoctor and a priest at Parkland Hospital saying that John Kennedywas dead. Eddie Barker, KRLD’s news director, had been stationed atthe Trade Mart. Eddie had an excellent source, a high-rankingParkland Hospital official, who had corroborated what I had beentold. If I were still working the Houston police beat at 61 RiesnerStreet for KHOU, this would have been more than enoughconfirmation. What we had was a dead man. But this was not justany dead man. This was the president of the United States.I got on the phone with CBS radio in New York. A guy I knewwell, Mort Dank, was on the other end of the line. Mort asked mewhat the situation was, and I told him the president was dead. Thenext thing I heard was Allan Jackson, our New York radio announcer,somberly intoning, “The president of the United States is dead,”followed by the playing of “The Star Spangled Banner.”I was still on the phone with Mort. Dumbstruck, I said, “Wait aminute! I didn’t say go with that!”“Well,” Mort replied, “you told me he was dead.”I had expected that Mort would pass the information up tosomeone in higher authority to clear it for broadcast before it wentout over the airwaves. Now, of course, it was impossible to take itback, in effect to unring the bell. On the TV side, Barker’s report andmine were mentioned, but Ernie Leiser made the decision to wait forofficial word before formally announcing the news on television.Finally Mac Kilduff, the White House assistant press secretary, madethe announcement and confirmed the news.CBS stayed on the air for the next four days straight, withoutcommercial interruption, covering the assassination, the execution ofLee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby, and the presidential funeral.Although I’d gone to Dallas as the coverage coordinator, with theexpectation that other correspondents would do most of thereporting, during those four days people saw a lot of me on the air.There was no time now to craft a masterful script in the manner ofKuralt or Collingwood; there was no time to craft a script at all.When it was airtime, it was just stand and deliver. Even though I was bone weary by the end, both my ability to keep my emotions incheck and my ability to ad-lib proved valuable.Television coverage of this national tragedy changed the country.It also changed the relationship people at home had with theirtelevision. Families sat riveted to their TVs for hours on end, almostas if sitting at a wake. Television became the medium that linked ourpeople together in times of tragedy or disaster; it still fulfills thatfunction today. TV coverage of the Kennedy assassination united thecountry in national mourning and set the stage for coverage of othercatastrophes in the future, including the Robert Kennedy and MartinLuther King assassinations just five years later.By now, the story of the assassination of John Kennedy has becomean oft-told tale, and like most stories it has both gained and lost inthe retelling. Sadly, two generations of younger Americans think theyknow a lot more about the death of President Kennedy than they do.Sadder still, much of what they know ain’t so, having been gleanedfrom Oliver Stone’s 1991 movieJFK. The film is not history. It is nota documentary. It is a Hollywood movie, a fictionalized story based—loosely—on historical events. The assassination still has many openquestions, some of which may never be answered with certainty.Stone’s disservice to history is that he sacrificed accuracy toentertainment. The script blends fact and speculation so seamlesslythat it is very difficult to know where one leaves off and the otherbegins.After the assassination, there was much condemnation of theWarren Commission. The country was reeling; speculation about aconspiracy was rampant. New rumors surfaced almost daily.Commission members were under tremendous pressure to get out areport as fast as possible so the country could begin to heal. Withoutquestion, some of the commission’s work was not perfect, but thatdoesn’t mean it came to the wrong conclusion. I may be one of thefew people who actually read the entire commission report fromcover to cover. My primary criticism is that they shut down too soon.After they issued their findings, it would have been far better to have left the door ajar, retaining a small Warren Commission office and askeletal staff with the ability and the authority to investigate otherleads that might surface in the future, or even to reinvestigateexisting evidence based on new breakthroughs in forensictechnology.Was there a conspiracy? Keep in mind that for a reporter, therecould not be any bigger story than to reveal that the assassinationwas not what it appeared to be. But the facts just do not go in thatdirection. I’ve now participated in four independent investigations, allof which attempted to prove that Oswald could not have been theassassin. Because there was a widely held belief that no one couldget off that number of shots that accurately and that quickly at thatdistance, the most painstaking of these investigations involved anelaborate re-creation of the assassination. In the early 1970s, wespent more than half a million dollars of CBS’s money on a re-enactment. We built a track for a Lincoln Continental and wentthrough a precisely choreographed replay of the events of thatdreadful day.What we discovered was quite the opposite of what we set out toprove. We showed that the actual distance was not that formidable.We also demonstrated that it was possible for a shooter to squeezeoff the required number of rounds in the allotted time frame. Fromthe sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository, whatOswald saw through the gunsight of his Mannlicher-Carcano rifle washis victim, first up close, then receding in a straight line,not crossingin front of him. In other words, even though the limousine wasmoving, President Kennedy remained in the crosshairs. At thatrange, it didn’t take a super marksman.Although there are many conspiracy theories about othersharpshooters firing from different vantage points, there is no hardevidence to support that contention. If shots had been fired from thegrassy knoll, as is commonly alleged, those bullets had to have gonesomewhere. But where? No one has ever found any hard evidencedocumenting where those shots might have landed.I don’t want to leave any ambiguity about my belief that LeeHarvey Oswald was the shooter, the only shooter. For me, the primary issue revolves around the question of who, if anyone,assisted him. To date there is still little, if any, concrete evidence tosupport the conjecture that others were involved. I remain open-minded about the possibilities, but frankly, I do not believe thatthere was a conspiracy. That being said, I do think the time hasfinally come to put an end to all the theories and speculation. Alongthose lines, if the CIA has any further information, it should releaseit. Whatever the justification for secrecy might have been back in theday, surely it no longer exists. As a journalist, my position is that theAmerican people have a right to know, and that the time forwithholding information for the good of the country, emotionally orpolitically, has long passed.One truism in investigations is that truth will come out. Thisapplies especially to conspiracies, which by definition means morethan one person is involved. People who have information eventuallyfeel compelled to tell someone else. They whisper it to their priests,wives, children, girlfriends. Over five decades, this has nothappened. There have been no deathbed confessions, no “now itcan be told” first-person revelations.Much of what we would have liked to know died with Lee HarveyOswald. Now I fear the odds are getting smaller and smaller that wewill ever know more than what we do now. For me as a journalist, itwill continue to nag at me that I may never get to the truth. I havecontinued to follow leads and possibilities ever since that day in lateNovember 1963, and I will continue to do so, but I don’t have anyexpectation that these speculations about the murder of a presidentwill be resolved in my lifetime, if ever.I stayed in Dallas for about two weeks, covering the aftermath ofthe assassination. While there, my emotions about the murder of thepresident eventually did come to the surface. I did speak to Jeanimmediately and we shared the feelings that I imagine all Americanswere feeling at that time. The children were of an age that they didnot understand what was happening, but I asked them to sing somepatriotic songs about America with their mother. By the time I leftDallas, I was no longer southern bureau chief, based in NewOrleans. I was instead headed to Washington to cover our new president, Lyndon Baines Johnson, as chief White Housecorrespondent. CHAPTER 5 Presidents I Have Known, Part IIn the modern era, the press and the presidency are joined at thehip, but this symbiotic relationship is imbued with an inescapabledynamic tension. The press and the public have an insatiableappetite for information. Divulging that information is not always inthe best interest of any particular president. Let me explain.In the White House, “free press” is a double entendre. The mediarepresents the people’s right to know, and the right to publish whatthey find out. This is what journalists mean by “free press.” TheWhite House uses the media to trumpet its successes and play downor explain away its failures. For them, press coverage is a simpleextension of public relations or free advertising. For the WhiteHouse, “making the news” offers an opportunity to place their ownimprint or spin on events, gratis. This is an entirely differentunderstanding of the term “free press.”In one capacity or another, I’ve been covering the presidencysince the Eisenhower administration. Over that period, presidentshave developed increasingly sophisticated strategies for dealing withjournalists, and each president has carved out a differentrelationship with the press. Some have wholeheartedly embraced themedia; others have been ambivalent or inconsistent; still others havesought to wall us out entirely. Almost all administrations, however,find reasons to try to manipulate the press for their own ends. For ajournalist, therefore, to cover the presidency is to deal withpoliticization of the news.White House efforts to control the flow of news, however, is aslippery slope. There are times when this involves legitimate issuesof national security. It would not have been in the public interest forthe president to have revealed details of the secret expedition to killOsama bin Laden in advance. Other times, of course, nationalsecurity is deployed as a smokescreen to shield events that are embarrassing or even felonious, such as Watergate, from publicscrutiny.EisenhowerAs supreme allied commander in Europe during World War II,Dwight David Eisenhower was responsible for the planning andexecution of the D-Day invasion. After the war, he becameeverybody’s first-choice nominee. Courted by Democrats andRepublicans alike, he declined to run in 1948 but chose to run as aRepublican in 1952. He was elected by a landslide with 442 electoralvotes, compared to just 89 for Adlai Stevenson.Eisenhower was our last president who was not press-centric.Perhaps it was his military background, or perhaps it was hisenduring popularity, but Ike simply never felt the need to beconcerned about the press all that much. Luckily, he had one of thebest press secretaries in history. Jim Hagerty held that positionlonger than anyone else: eight years—throughout both of Ike’sterms, start to finish. Nobody did it longer; nobody has done itbetter. Hagerty was surely one of the best informed and mostinfluential press secretaries. He not only had Eisenhower’sconfidence; he had his ear.My brief interaction with Eisenhower happened toward the end ofhis second term. Ike had scheduled a goodwill trip to Russia, Japan,Taiwan and the Philippines. At the time, I was news director atKHOU in Houston. Cal Jones, my boss, had the idea that I should goon the trip and do a one-hour special program on it when I returned.Unfortunately, the trip started falling apart before it began. Anti-American protesters in the streets of Tokyo made the Japan leg ofthe trip impossible. The Russian portion was scrapped in theaftermath of the U-2 spy plane incident and the subsequentexchange of pilot Francis Gary Powers for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel.We flew with the president to Taiwan and visited Quemoy andMatsu, two Taiwanese island chains that had been claimed byMainland China. Later that fall the islands became a topic in the debate between Kennedy and Nixon, but Eisenhower’s visit wasintended simply to demonstrate our support for Taiwan on the issue.Because so much of the trip had been scrubbed, to eat up time wethen took a slow boat from Taiwan to the Philippines. Finally, the tripended with a week-long vacation in Hawaii for Eisenhower, whoplayed golf every morning.It was a pretty big deal for me to be included at all. There wereonly two local station TV journalists on the trip, myself and FrankReynolds, then with CBS affiliate WBBM in Chicago. None of us,including the dozen regular White House correspondents, had anyreal access to Eisenhower, but because I was a local reporter with noWhite House experience, I had no seniority, either. This was a realdisadvantage, since everything was allocated according to your rankin the press corps pecking order, from seating in the bus (I was inthe last row, over the engine) to who was selected to join the groupwatching Eisenhower tee off at the golf course.I had a lucky break one morning in Hawaii, when one of thedesignated reporters dropped out and I was asked to go in his place.That particular morning, the president was late to the golf course.Ike could be snappy and downright standoffish, and at firstobservation he did not seem to be in a particularly good mood. Butas soon as he flashed that disarming grandfatherly smile, theatmosphere immediately improved. Eisenhower had a commandpresence. As a five-star general, as president of Columbia Universityafter the war, and as a two-time landslide president, he exuded areassuring aura of confidence that left no doubt that he was the guyin charge.These morning gatherings at the golf course were neversupposed to be full-blown press conferences. Today we would callthem simple photo ops. Eisenhower had had a heart attack in 1955,and this part of the trip was meant to reassure the press and thepublic alike that the president was healthy and vigorous. It was allstrictly informal—reporters were allowed to ask a few softballquestions and watch the president tee off. After that a White Housestaffer would say, “That’s it, boys” (at the time, the presidentialpress corps was still all male), and we were ushered away. On the plane coming home, I started to worry when I realizedthat I had nothing to show for having been on the trip. Havingtraveled with the president from Taiwan to the Philippines to Hawaii,I had virtually no newsworthy information about him whatsoever. Iexpressed my concern to one of the more experiencedphotographers, who offered to talk to Hagerty on my behalf. Hagertywas nice enough to give me an “exclusive” interview regarding thedetails of the president’s assurances that we would protect Taiwan’ssovereignty over Quemoy and Matsu. It was enough to save mybacon back in Houston, where Cal Jones understood that I hadmade the best of what were very slim pickings indeed.The Eisenhower administration marks the beginning of a longrun-up of corporate influence on the American political scene.Charles Erwin Wilson, aka “Engine Charlie,” became president ofGeneral Motors in January 1941 and oversaw GM’s transformationfrom a maker of family sedans into a manufacturer of tanks, aircraftand armaments—the linchpin of what FDR called “the arsenal ofdemocracy.” Wilson was still president of GM in January 1953 whenEisenhower tapped him to become his secretary of defense.During his Senate confirmation hearings, Wilson was asked if hewould be able to make a decision that was contrary to the interestsof General Motors. He answered yes, but added that he could notimagine such a situation “because for years I thought what wasgood for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa.”Wilson was not being facetious. At the time, the employeepopulation of General Motors exceeded that of Nevada and Delawarecombined. Ever since, Wilson has been famously misquoted ashaving said, “What’s good for General Motors is good for thecountry.”Whichever way you put it, the concept developed a life of its own.The idea that the interests of big business and the interests of theUnited States are aligned has been with us ever since. TheEisenhower administration was unabashedly pro-business, andfrankly most people didn’t find this to be a problem. In Texas it wastaken as gospel: When corporations do well, they do well for their workers. When workers do well, they buy products. It was an articleof faith that we all believed in.For several generations, we all reaped the benefits; now though,we’re reaping the downside. Especially in the wake of the 2010Citizens United ruling by the Supreme Court, it is an open subjectwhether today we still have a government of the people, by thepeople and for the people, or whether it has become a governmentof corporations, by corporations and for corporations.Over the years, I have given the Eisenhower presidency muchhigher marks than was considered fashionable. Ike negotiated anend to the Korean War, broadened the reach of Social Security andbuilt the Interstate Highway System. In 1957 he also federalized theArkansas National Guard after Governor Orval Faubus called themout in an attempt to defy a Supreme Court ruling to integrate thestate’s public schools. Eisenhower was perhaps not so much pro-integration as he was anti-insubordination. As head of the federalgovernment, no governor was going to be allowed to flout federalauthority on his watch. In true commander-in-chief style,Eisenhower countered Faubus by deploying the 101st Airborne toescort black students into Little Rock’s Central High.To my mind, however, above and beyond these importantaccomplishments, Eisenhower deserves a special place in the historyof American presidents because he gave what may be the secondmost important speech that any contemporary American presidenthas delivered. (Given at the depths of the Depression, FDR’s 1933first inaugural address—“the only thing we have to fear is fearitself”—probably ranks first.) In his January 1961 farewell address,Eisenhower warned against the ascendancy of what he was the firstto call the “military-industrial complex.” “The potential for thedisastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist,” he said.“We must never let the weight of this combination endanger ourliberties or democratic processes.”Eisenhower was the first president of the television era, but hedid not use the medium well. Listening to that speech on radio, it isextremely powerful. Viewed on television, however, it loses itsintensity; the screen is dominated by the top of Ike’s bald head as he’s reading. Eisenhower was not a gifted orator, and at the time hegave it, the speech did not resonate the way it should have. It isonly with the benefit of hindsight that its importance has beenrealized. Would that we had paid more heed to his admonition.KennedyMy first contact with John F. Kennedy was when he became theDemocratic presidential nominee at the 1960 convention in LosAngeles. I interviewed him at the time and came away impressed. Itwas evident even then that he was a forceful personality and apersuasive speaker. After that I covered some of his speeches;finally, of course, I was in Dallas for the campaign stop that endedhis life.JFK was the first president born in the 20th century. Young andhandsome, he was very image conscious, even early in his career. Ithad little to do with vanity. As a politician with ambitions towardhigher office, he knew his physical appearance was an attribute thatcould be exploited for political advantage. While still a senator,Kennedy retained the services of Howell Conant, Grace Kelly’sfavorite photographer. In all likelihood, Grace made thearrangements herself; the Kellys were to Philadelphia what theKennedys were to Boston, and the two clans had first met sometimein the late 1940s.Kennedy had no interest in sitting for an official portrait; instead,he gave Conant an unusual assignment. He asked to bephotographed from every angle imaginable. The two then poredover the photos, studying them carefully. Kennedy wanted to learnwhich were his best camera angles and which were to be avoided.Conant gave him the same advice he gave to Grace Kelly. Both werecounseled never to be photographed straight on—he because hiseyes were set too close together, she because of her square jaw.John F. Kennedy was truly our first TV president. Althoughtelevision had come of age during the Eisenhower administration,Ike had dismissed it as an entertainment medium. Kennedy, on the other hand, was acutely aware of the power of television to swaypublic opinion. He seized the challenge and the opportunity oftelevision and used the medium well. Not surprisingly, he was veryinvolved with camera angles and lighting and makeup for histelevised appearances, just as he had been with his stillphotography.Televised news conferences had been initiated underEisenhower’s press secretary Jimmy Hagerty but were boosted intoprominence by Kennedy and his press secretary, Pierre Salinger.These sessions showcased not only Kennedy’s physicalattractiveness, but also the fact that he was witty, articulate andquick on his feet. He came across as warm and genuine andcomfortable in his own skin.When it came to his relationship with the press, JFK wasextremely accessible, as was Salinger. The two had a close personalrelationship. Salinger was an adjunct member of Kennedy’s “kitchencabinet”; he had real access to the president, and Kennedy trustedhim completely.The White House used this easy access to generate positivecoverage; it was a way to cultivate the image of the Kennedyadministration as open and forthcoming. Salinger knew whoPresident Kennedy liked in the press corps, and they unquestionablyplayed favorites. They rewarded their friends, cold-shouldered theirenemies and more or less gently herded those in between. Theytook this approach with both print and television media, but theywent out of their way to cultivate TV journalists, often giving thempreference over print reporters. On-air White House correspondentsreally became center stage for the first time during Kennedy’spresidency.Friends in the media were rewarded with greater access, not justin press conferences but for innovative special broadcasts as well.The Kennedys opened the White House to a televised tour, hosted bythe first lady with my friend and mentor Charles Collingwood. It wasan excellent use of television for an ostensibly nonpartisan activity,one of the earliest examples of what would become known as“campaigning from the Rose Garden.” JohnsonThings changed when Johnson became president, or as the wagssoon put it, “Austin isn’t Boston.” Lyndon Johnson had learned a lotabout television from Kennedy but couldn’t match his image or hisstyle.It took him a while to find his own. LBJ ached to be a good TVpresident, but he went through some awkward phases in search ofhis on-air persona. First was the cowboy phase: hats, boots,everything but a bolo tie. He was comfortable—for him this waspretty much his native garb—but he was told that the image heprojected was a bit too rodeo and not sufficiently presidential. Thenhe went into his teacher mode. Early on, he had been a teacher inthe small town of Cotulla. Tweedy, however, did not suit him. Afterthat he tried on the image of the businessman president, but eventhen he didn’t get it quite right. He debuted the look wearing a darksuit with a piece of jewelry at the neck, where only the knot of thetie should have been.Unfortunately, a lot of Johnson’s image problem was physical, notsartorial. He was a large man with prominent ears and huge handslike a polar bear. He was hardscrabble. In sharp contrast with JFK,he was not born to privilege, and it showed in his craggy face. Soonafter becoming president, he held a news conference in the EastRoom of the White House. The room was crowded with press;television cameras were set up everywhere. After it was over, LBJviewed the videotape with Lady Bird, who was horrified. “Lyndon,your ears look enormous!” she is reported to have said. “You looklike Dumbo.” True enough. Johnson’s big ears, viewed from the side,looked even bigger. Johnson’s solution was a simple one: That wasthe last of the side camera shots.Johnson always believed that he was his own best presssecretary, and in many ways, he was. Pierre Salinger lasted less thana year with LBJ, having stayed on as part of the transition team afterKennedy’s assassination. In August 1964, he was replaced by GeorgeReedy. Even as Johnson was the antithesis of Kennedy, Reedy was the antithesis of Salinger. Salinger’s MO was to pop a few back,smoke a cigar and admire the trailer on some woman walking by.Reedy was a pipe smoker, and I can remember going into his officeand seeing him enveloped in curls of pipe smoke. He was awonderful, gentle man, professorial, intellectual and academic.Johnson, as he could do with such people, beat him like a rentedmule—psychologically, that is. Johnson was irascible. He went off onpeople, and frankly, Reedy was too decent a person to handle it. Hedidn’t last long.Bill Moyers took over for him in 1965 but was soon replaced byGeorge Christian. Christian was a laid-back Texan, having been presssecretary to Governor John Connally. He is not well known becausehe kept himself out of the limelight, but he was one of the bestpress secretaries in the history of the White House. It was GeorgeChristian who served as press secretary during the most tumultuousyears of Johnson’s presidency, from 1966 through 1969. By thistime, the war in Vietnam was going badly, and LBJ was sinking inthe polls. George worked hard at taking reporters aside, maybe in asmall group, or more typically one on one. “Dan, can I see you aminute? I’m not bitching or moaning, and I want you to take this inthe spirit in which I’m saying it, but you’re off on this. Let me tellyou why.”Christian was effective not just because of the way he handledthe press, but because of the way he handled his boss. He was notfazed or intimidated by Johnson’s choleric outbursts. Salinger, Reedyand Moyers had all tried and failed. A key part of Christian’s strategywas to avoid direct confrontations with Johnson and come at hot-button issues obliquely.One story George told me from early in his time as presssecretary illustrates his approach. “Mr. President, I am pleased to behere and honored to be of service to you and to the country. But Iam no miracle worker, and I want to disabuse you of that. I cannotturn things on a dime here. Let’s take your problems one at a time. Iam not going to try to solve everything. Give me the problem thatworries you the most, and let me begin by taking on that one.” “George,” LBJ responded, “everywhere I look those sum’ bitches—the press—are quoting me as saying, ‘I will not send Americanboys to do what Asian boys should be doing for themselves.’ I amsupposed to have said that early in our involvement in Vietnam, andGeorge, I never said it. Still, it keeps coming back to haunt me. Nowit’s become some version of goddamn urban myth. I am tired ofgetting hit over the head with it. Fix it.”“Okay, Mr. President.”George returned after a few days to give Johnson a report onwhat he discovered. “Mr. President, I don’t want you to get mad atme. I haven’t solved this problem, but I want to show you thedimensions of it.” At that, several interns entered the office carryingstacks and stacks of newspapers and magazines. “Mr. President,every one of these publications has you saying it—not just as anindirect quote, but in direct quotes.”“That’s what I am telling you, George!” Johnson shouted. “Theykeep printing it, but it isn’t true. I never said it.”A couple of days later, Christian returned to the Oval Office with atape recorder. He placed it on the desk and said, “Mr. President, Idon’t want you to get mad at me, but the puzzle is deepening.” Withthat, Christian pressed “Play” on the recorder, and there came theunmistakable voice of LBJ saying the quote.Johnson’s temper got the better of him once again, and hedemolished the tape recorder with his polar bear paws. “Goddamn,George! I didn’t realize what a complete idiot you really are. Youknow what these guys do: They piece these things together, theytake a little razor blade, cut a piece here and add there.”“I believe you, Mr. President,” Christian answered patiently, “but Iwanted you to know that these recordings are everywhere.”About a week later, LBJ hosted a group of guests in the WhiteHouse screening room for a showing ofThe Alamo, with JohnWayne. George was in attendance. “Mr. President, I’d appreciate it ifwe could get together, just the two of us, after the movie. I havesomething I’d like you to see.”After the guests departed, Christian gave the signal to roll hisfootage. Up on the full screen came the unmistakable image of LBJ, standing on the bumper of a limo on a darkened street corner inPhiladelphia. Johnson was speaking through a bullhorn, saying, “Iwill not send American boys to do what Asian boys should be doingfor themselves!”“Damn, George,” Johnson said as the lights came back up. “Yousure that’s me?”Despite his coarse demeanor, LBJ was actually quite intelligent.His great strength and expertise was that he knew where the leversof power were in Washington and knew when to pull them, or not.He was very aware that he had inherited an enormous amount ofgoodwill coming into the presidency on the heels of a tragedy. Healso knew that goodwill would not last forever. He used his graceperiod to push through civil rights legislation and the rest of what hecalled the Great Society.I covered him twice as White House correspondent, first in theimmediate aftermath of the Kennedy assassination, and a secondtime after I returned from Vietnam. Johnson took JFK’s cue aboutpress access and ran with it, so much so that reporters actually gottired of seeing him. When I was on that beat, it was not unusual tobe in the Oval Office five or six times a day, which was unheard of,before or since. Johnson would have frequent photo ops with visitingdignitaries, which afforded the chance to ask a question or two.LBJ did have a great sense of humor, but most of his best lineswere not suitable for television, or indeed for repetition in politecompany. Profanity and salty innuendo were his stock-in-trade. Oneday he began talking about how public opinion was building upagainst him because of Vietnam. Another correspondent—not me,I’m happy to say—asked what effect that growing negativesentiment was having on him. “I’m like a bitch dog in heat,” LBJreplied. “If I stand still, they stick it to me. If I run, they bite myass.”Presidents don’t talk like that anymore. God knows, Johnsoncould be crass. He’d have reporters up to the living quarters, andafter 20 minutes or so he’d say, “Boys, let’s break this off for aminute. I gotta go take a piss.” And yes, he said it just that way.He’d go into the bathroom, leave the door halfway open, relieve himself, and then come back saying, “Now, where were we?” He didwash his hands, though.LBJ and I had an awkward relationship. He was all Texas, andbecause I was a fellow Texan, Johnson always believed that entitledhim to a free pass. It was a sore subject throughout his presidency.He seemed to expect some sort of Lone Star dispensation. That, ofcourse, was something I just could not give.NixonOddly enough, I was immediately seared with the LBJ brand as soonas Nixon became president. I was sitting in a small café in LagunaBeach, California, when H. R. Haldeman, Nixon’s chief of staff, slidinto my booth. In 1969, he was perhaps the last civilian in Americasporting a crew cut. I started to introduce myself, but he cut meshort. “We know who you are,” he said curtly. “You’re an LBJ man.”I found this weird to say the least, especially since I had justbeen through all those years with Johnson and his people saying,“Rather, you’re a Texan. What the hell is wrong with you? Why thehell don’t you get on board and play on the team here, son?”Once I recovered from my surprise I said, “I’m sorry you feel thatway. I’m an independent reporter, and I work for a newsorganization that has a reputation for independent reporting. I hopeto prove to you that I have no bias, but that doesn’t mean you’llalways like what I’m going to report.”Haldeman was having none of it. “We know who you are,” herepeated. “You’re a Texas liberal Democrat, and we’ll be watchingyour ass.” It wasn’t quite menacing, but there was surely a cold lookin his eye.Nixon’s press secretary was Ron Ziegler, a good-natured guy whowas a member of what had been dubbed the “USC Mafia” on theWhite House staff. As a young man, his first job had been atDisneyland in Anaheim, where he started out as a jovial,wisecracking helmsman on the Jungle Cruise attraction. Afterworking press for Nixon’s failed run at the California governorship in 1962, he had signed on at the J. Walter Thompson ad agency, wherehe reported to Haldeman.Why is Ziegler’s gig at Disneyland relevant? Because those jungleriverboats run on a track. The job of helmsman involves no steering,and the witty commentary he delivered was completely scripted.Being Richard Nixon’s press secretary was pretty much the samething.The Nixon White House saw the press secretary as a minion.Ziegler’s job was to go forth and speak from whatever libretto theyhanded him. He had virtually no access to Nixon himself, receivingall of his marching orders from his ventriloquist, Haldeman.Dating from his 1960 loss to Kennedy, Nixon distrusted the press.Arguably, he distrusted our network in particular, since CBS hadhosted the famous “makeup debate” that Nixon among others cameto believe cost him the election. From that point forward, he soughtto manipulate and control the media. Whenever possible, he did notenter any press landscape that he did not operate or command.Although he took questions from reporters while he was running foroffice, they were seldom spontaneous. Under Haldeman’s direction,they’d stack the deck; questions were prearranged and topics wereassigned to specific journalists.During the campaign, virtually everything Nixon said was scriptedand on message. That approach carried through into the WhiteHouse. After the inauguration, the freewheeling days of easy pressaccess to the Oval Office under LBJ instantly disappeared. Thenumber of press conferences shrank drastically.Every appearance by the president was carefully orchestrated.Haldeman micromanaged every detail. When I was granted a prime-time interview with Nixon in early 1972, I was told that Nixonpreferred to be interviewed in front of a fireplace. Fireplacenotwithstanding, when I arrived, it was like walking into a meatlocker. The temperature was above freezing, but only just.The thermostat was dialed way down because Nixon wasextremely sensitive about his tendency to perspire heavily. He waswhat we in Texas used to call a sweater, but he did not want to becaught on camera dabbing at his upper lip. The fireplace, which was Haldeman’s idea, was the ideal backdrop to project an image ofwarmth, warmth that Nixon was never able to conjure up personally.I was very lucky to have Robert Pierpoint with me while I coveredthe White House, and I valued him as a colleague. When LBJ wasstill president, I’d been moved in over Bob as chief White Housecorrespondent. Nevertheless, he had elected to stay on. He was aterrific reporter and extremely savvy. As soon as the Nixon peoplecame in, Bob made what turned out to be a very prescientobservation. “They’ll try to divide and conquer,” he told me. “This isa very television-conscious administration, and Haldeman thinks heknows everything about TV because he’s been in advertising.They’re going to size up our situation, see that they’ve got asomewhat older guy and a younger guy who has been brought inover him, and they’re going to try to drive a wedge between us.”Bob was right on the money. To Pierpoint’s everlasting credit, hegave them nothing but cold steel every time they tried to wedge us,which was often. Oddly enough, Nixon’s people never seemed to getit—the more they pushed, the less successful they became.It’s not that the Nixonites were uncomfortable with journalists;theyhated journalists. Nixon was driven by a toxic combination ofcynicism and personal insecurity, mixed with just enough hubris tomake him sure everyone else in politics was just like him. He wassuspicious; his mind leapt to thinking the worst of everyone. Thepresumption was that you were an enemy until you provedotherwise. In short, Nixon was a hater, and organizations take on thecolors of their leaders.How serious was this hatred? Deadly serious. In a recent bookentitledPoisoning the Press, Mark Feldstein lays out the details ofthe plan by Watergate conspirators E. Howard Hunt and G. GordonLiddy to murder syndicated columnist Jack Anderson.Their plot was far more than mere conjecture. It was openlydiscussed on the secret White House tapes, and both Hunt and Liddyadmitted their participation under oath. In James Bond fashion, thetwo consulted with a CIA toxicologist in search of a lethalpharmaceutical that would leave no trace behind. One suggestionwas to slather a “massive dose” of LSD on the steering wheel of Anderson’s sedan to provoke a fatal hallucinogen-induced car crash.(The old-school idea of simply rigging an accident was alsoconsidered.) Another possibility was what they termed “aspirinroulette”—introducing one or two poison pills into the bottle ofAnderson’s headache remedy of choice.Hunt testified that the directive had come from White Housespecial counsel Chuck Colson, but Feldstein convincingly makes thecase that Colson was not acting independently. Nixon never forgot agrudge, and the bad blood between him and Anderson went back along way. Feldstein contends that during the 1960 campaign againstKennedy, Anderson had put out a story about a 1956 “loan” fromHoward Hughes to Nixon’s brother. Hughes had given Donald Nixonmore than $200,000, ostensibly to shore up his financially troubledfast-food restaurant in Whittier. Anderson alleged that this had beena political payoff that had nothing to do with Donald and everythingto do with his brother the vice president. He had a lot of compellingcircumstantial evidence.Just a few weeks later, the IRS granted tax-exempt status to theHoward Hughes Medical Institute, which it had previously denied.Twice. The loan was never repaid, and the burger stand went belly-up the next year, but the vice president and his wife, Pat, hadpurchased a brand-new home right after Donald got the money.Nixon blamed Anderson’s column as a major factor in his loss to JFK,and the incident continued to rankle years later. Worse, Andersonnever let up on Nixon; he kept publicizing embarrassing revelationsin his “Washington Merry-Go-Round” column, including Nixon’s effortto have John Lennon deported.Homicide plots notwithstanding, the Nixonites’ hatred of the pressled them to do a lot of what they thought were smart things thatturned out to be really dumb things. From my time covering LBJ, Iprided myself on having sources inside the White House. So didevery other White House correspondent worthy of the name. Thesesources were the assistants, aides, secretaries—folks you couldreach by phone, take out for a drink, take out to lunch. In my case,there were also some guys I had known in Vietnam who were nowin the Pentagon. I knew I could always give them a call, but under Johnson, we never had to go too far beyond the White House towork a story.With the new administration, it was good-bye to all that. TheNixon people stonewalled everybody except known sycophants. Withthe change in administration, I had been looking forward todeveloping new sources, but it was made immediately clear thatthere would be no sources for me in the Nixon White House.“Hi, I’m Dan Rather. I’d like to introduce myself, either in personor by phone.”“Do yourself a favor and don’t ever call me again.” Every overtureended the same way. All my sources in the White House dried up.Pierpoint’s, too.My job was to cover the White House, and the White Housewasn’t talking to me. But Washington, then and now, runs on talk.Even if Nixon’s people weren’t talking to me, they had to be talkingtosomebody.The only thing to do was to branch out and cultivate outsidesources—to get the story from whoever was on the other end of theline. A political reporter’s contacts are everything; I begandeveloping chiefs of staff of key congressmen and senators.Pierpoint had good sources on the Hill, as well as in the cabinet. Ialso made a conscious effort to expand my contacts at the Pentagon—to get passed along to other sources by people I’d known inVietnam who could vouch for me.The efforts began to pay off. I’d go with my notepad to a WhiteHouse briefing, listen to Ziegler deliver the Jungle Cruise scriptedmessage, then come back and work the phones to find out what wasreally going on. Sometimes my source would confirm what I’d heardfrom the White House. Other times I’d be told, “That’s bullshit. Meetme tonight in Arlington for a drink, and I’ll tell you what I know.”We broke story after story and monitored the rising consternationand anger within the White House. Nixon, Haldeman and WhiteHouse adviser John Ehrlichman became obsessed with finding outwho was leaking to the press. Their plumbers put a blowtorch toevery source in the White House, but they never figured out thatthey were looking into the wrong end of the hose. How bad did it get? Bad enough that in 1971, John Ehrlichmanhad breakfast with CBS News Div president Dick Salant to suggestsending me to Austin to open a new bureau, or on a year’s vacation,Dick’s choice. To his death, Ehrlichman swore that he was onlykidding. And if you believe that, you believe that water runs uphill.In the Nixon White House, nothing was said in jest, especially not byJohn Ehrlichman or Bob Haldeman, the twin bulwarks of what wasprivately known as Nixon’s “Berlin Wall.”In the aftermath of this very blatant effort to get rid of me, Idemanded a face-to-face meeting with Ehrlichman. He was hostilefrom the outset. He accused me of going on air with stories thatwere deliberately wrong or misleading. I assured him that anycorrespondent with that kind of record for inaccuracy would becanned in short order. When I asked him for an example, he couldn’tcome up with one. Then he said something that has stuck in mymind ever since: “The problem with you, Rather, is that peoplebelieve you.” That was my crime—not that I was wrong, but thatpeople believed me.When I first arrived at his office, Ehrlichman had been veryspecific about which chair I was to sit in. As I sat down, I noticed abriefcase nearby. I immediately wondered whether there was arecording device inside, but I dismissed the idea out of hand. “Tooparanoid,” I thought at the time.This was before Watergate, but as the saying goes, “Just becauseyou’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get you.”In April 1972, our daughter, Robin, by then a teenager, came intoour bedroom at about midnight and woke us up. “I hear someone onthe back stairs,” she said. At that point I did what any Texan woulddo: I made sure the family was safe, then grabbed the shotgun.Ours was a three-story house, and all of the bedrooms wereupstairs. When I came out onto the top floor landing, I looked downthe stairwell and saw someone coming out of the basement. “I don’tknow who the hell you are or what you’re after,” I shouted, “but youbetter get the hell out of here!” With that, I chambered a round inthe shotgun. Clack. Click. Clack. Click. This was a pump-action shotgun, andthat sound is loud, unmistakable, and can be deadly in a hurry.Whoever was in the house got the message and fled. I found it oddthat no valuables had been stolen. The intruder, however, had clearlyrifled the files in my basement office.We filed a police report and chalked it up as a garden-variety caseof breaking and entering. At the time, the idea that it might havebeen more than that never occurred to either me or my wife.However, as Jean was describing the incident to a friend, the wife ofa young Republican senator, she looked at Jean with alarm. “This ispolitical,” she said immediately.On June 17, 1972, roughly two months later, five men werearrested as they broke into the headquarters of the DemocraticNational Committee in the Watergate Hotel. The group includedJames McCord, security director for the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CREEP).Coincidence, random events or part of a pattern of conspiratorialskullduggery? No one was ever caught in conjunction with the break-in at the Rathers’ house. I doubt that we will ever have confirmation,but I know how I connect the dots. Our house in Washington wassupposed to be empty that weekend. I was scheduled to go toFlorida with the rest of the press corps to cover Nixon’s trip to KeyBiscayne. Jean, Robin and Danjack had planned to come along, butstayed home after Robin developed a fever…… Their reservations on the press plane had been booked by theWhite House.From the moment the Watergate story first broke in June 1972, BobWoodward and Carl Bernstein of theWashington Post were way outin front with their coverage. They did a magnificent job. That said,all of us quickly realized that there could be more to the incidentthan first reported. CBS News Division made the decision to swarmthe story, just as we had with civil rights and Vietnam. We veryquickly formed a unit, which besides me also included Daniel Schorr,and of course Bob Pierpoint. The Nixonites didn’t like me, but they really despised DanielSchorr. In 1971, the FBI had interrogated his friends, relatives andcolleagues at the direction of the White House, ostensibly becausehe was under consideration for a post with the EPA. They alsotapped Schorr’s phones and went digging for dirt in his financialrecords. In reality, there was no such post; Haldeman eventuallytestified that he had authorized the investigation.Especially in the initial stages, Pierpoint, Schorr and I could notmatch what Woodward and Bernstein were coming up with, but thenagain, no one could. We were running down every lead, but oftenenough what we had was just not as good as what they had. At thatpoint there was a command decision, made by Bill Small,Washington bureau chief, and approved by News Div president DickSalant, that we could report Woodward and Bernstein’sbreakthroughs on air, credit theWashington Post, and thensupplement it with whatever else we had uncovered.This made the White House apoplectic. Their prime damage-control strategy had been to keep it local. The Beltway was theirMaginot Line; if they could hold the Watergate story within DC bychalking it up to the excesses of two junior reporters from thehometown paper, they had a chance of keeping a lid on it. The factthat CBS—national television—was picking up items from Woodwardand Bernstein blew their containment strategy out of the water.The White House fought back by playing hardball with KatharineGraham, publisher of theWashington Post. John Mitchell’s famousthreat that Mrs. Graham was going to “get her tit caught in a big fatwringer” if Woodward and Bernstein continued pursuing the story,became one of the pivotal moments in the filmAll the President’sMen. In addition, Nixon himself privately threatened “damnable,damnable problems” with the FCC. ThePost owned several veryprofitable television stations, which put them at the mercy of theFCC, just like CBS. If the White House thought Mrs. Graham wouldbe cowed, they misjudged her. Katharine Graham deserves a lot ofcredit for standing up for her reporters.The White House also tried to pressure Bill Small, pushing himhard to stop picking up stories from thePost. Small was repeatedly called in for what he called séances with various top Nixon staffers.The thing about Bill Small is that he is absolutely rock solid. He hadconfidence in my ability as a reporter, and in Schorr and Pierpoint aswell. Beyond that, Bill was convinced that the story led up, way up.Our ratings got better and better, in part because we finally gotsome traction and were reporting things other people weren’treporting. The pressure from the White House got more intense aswe started finding things on our own. Pierpoint’s sources startedcoming through for him. Often enough, if he dug up something he’dgive it to me, because I could command airtime. We at CBS wererunning hard with the story from the first, even though ABC and NBCwere not.All of these factors swirled together as the story snowballed. Andas it snowballed, it seemed to suck up everyone in its path—All thePresident’s Men was well and truly named. From a break-in thatsupposedly had been perpetrated by a few rogue operators, itspread into CREEP, Nixon’s reelection campaign committee, then intoJohn Mitchell’s Department of Justice, then into the lower echelonsof the White House.The story was moving in my direction, which meant that thepressure was coming my way as well. There was even pressure fromwithin CBS News, in part because our Watergate coverage was so farout in front of the other two networks. Because ABC and NBC weremuch more wary of the story than we were for a long time, therewere some within our own News Division who murmured that theWashington correspondents were being irresponsible. It was all sottovoce, but the finely tuned CBS bush telegraph picked it upnevertheless.Some of the innuendo may have stemmed from a genuine beliefthat we were making too much out of nothing, or that we shouldhave been giving more credence to the raft of denials issued by theWhite House. Sadly, more than a little of it was also the old egomonster. Within CBS, some of those keeping score thought I wasgetting far more than my fair share of airtime, which could onlymean that they were getting far less. I never confronted those who said I was reckless in reporting Watergate, but Bob Pierpoint spokeup to defend all of us on numerous occasions.Dick Salant, God rest his soul and now long since gone, was theepitome of journalistic integrity and the best News Division presidentin the history of the game. He backstopped Bill Small at everyopportunity, and the rest of us as well. His attitude was, “We havegood people in place—Rather, Schorr, Pierpoint. I have confidence inthem.” End of story.Bill Paley always backed Salant, with only one exception that Iknow of. That occurred in late October 1972, in the immediate run-up to the November presidential election. Paley received what hemuch later described as a “vicious” phone call from Chuck Colson.Even then, Colson was known as Nixon’s hatchet man; it was Colsonwho put together the Enemies List. After the call, Paley pushedSalant to cancel the second installment of a two-parter we had puttogether on Watergate. Salant was astonished; never before hadPaley interfered at this level. Besides, the first segment had alreadybeen broadcast.Salant refused to pull the second segment, choosing to truncate itinstead. Paley hadn’t told him about Colson’s phone call; Salantlearned of Colson’s involvement only after the fact. Had Paleymentioned it, Salant later said, he never would have cut a syllable.The story stands as a vivid reminder of the enormous power thatgovernment officials, especially in Washington, possess and wield inan effort to manipulate the press. And as was the case here, most ofthe time those efforts occur in secret. I suspect that Colson impliedFCC problems for CBS in the same way that Mrs. Graham had beenthreatened.Paley was gingerly walking a tightrope. He still believed that thenews was the news, but he was taking heat, not just from theNixonites but from our affiliates as well. In an echo of what hadhappened during our coverage of the civil rights movement, therehad been a lot of pushback from the local CBS stations, whocomplained that Watergate coverage was hurting them financially. Inaddition, many of those station owners were staunch Nixon supporters. Paley may have passed these complaints on to Salant; ifhe did, they stopped there. They never filtered down to us at all.We reported the facts of the story as they emerged. We had thetotal and unwavering support of Bill Small and Dick Salant, and sofar as we knew we also had the support of William Paley, which hegave at some personal cost. Paley had always dreamed of beingappointed ambassador to the Court of St. James’s. When Nixon firsttook office in 1969, Paley thought he was in line to get that job, butNixon chose longtime pal (and far more generous contributor) WalterAnnenberg, publisher ofTV Guide. Although the White House stillconsidered Paley to be friendly, Nixon and his staff harboredanimosity toward CBS News, in particular toward Cronkite and me.As long as we were probing into Watergate, there would be noambassadorship for Paley.As Watergate continued to unfold, it affected me in a verypersonal way. I knew it was an important story, but I had anambivalent reaction to it. On the one hand, following its twists andturns was investigative journalism at its best. On the other hand,against all evidence to the contrary, I kept hoping that it would notreach the Oval Office.Going back to when I was first named White Housecorrespondent, I always had a special reverence for the presidency—not for the man, but for the office, for the institution itself. I felt itparticularly when I came back from Vietnam. By 1972, I had beenwalking through the White House security gate almost every day forsix years, and I got to know the guys at the gate very well. “Hello,Mr. Rather. How are you doing?” Whenever I’d walk through thegate, I’d well up inside. I could control it to a degree, but what waswelling up was patriotism—pride of country, pride in the office of thepresidency and pride in the part it plays in our democracy. I know itsounds corny, and in some ways I’m sure it is, but many others inthe White House press corps felt some version of the same.Now, however, as developments in the story got darker anddarker, there was a part of me that almost refused to believe whatwas happening. I’d go home at night and Jean would ask about myday. “Honey, you won’t believe it,” I’d say. “Every stone we turn up has another bunch of creepy-crawly characters underneath it.” Iknew what my reporter’s instincts and a lifetime of covering politicswere telling me, and I could clearly see that the trail of evidence waspointing where I did not want it to go. Still, I was reluctant tobelieve.Did I feel stressed out? You bet. As the importance of the storyburgeoned, Walter Cronkite got on the phone with me. “I knowyou’re under a lot of pressure, Dan. We feel it here, too. Just knowthat I’m behind you.”I had been surprised and even a little shocked when Cronkite hadreplaced Douglas Edwards on theEvening News shortly after Ijoined CBS. My respect and admiration for him grew as he settledinto the anchor chair. At first, I had little contact with him. It was notuntil the Kennedy assassination that we worked closely together.During that trying and testing time, my respect for him grew evengreater, and I believe he gained a new respect for the way I worked.In the years that followed, when I was at the White House and inVietnam, and especially when covering Watergate, there was notension, no problems between us. He became the country’s premiertelevision news anchor; I was one of his top field correspondents. Hewas helpful and supportive, and I reciprocated. We both thrived.Cronkite’s support mattered at a time when someone as powerfulas John Ehrlichman was still trying to get me fired. The White Housewas maintaining that the Watergate affair was nothing more than anoverblown media witch hunt in the wake of what Ziegler memorablytermed “a third-rate burglary.” I was still hearing whispers throughthe News Div grapevine that what I was doing was irresponsible.Those who did this will deny it to this day, but this is the truth as Iexperienced it. One very well known correspondent—a good man,and a good reporter—said, “Dan is moving too fast on this story, andhe’s out too far. He’s going to wreck the network. It would be onething if it just reflected on him, but he’s going to bring the rest of usdown with him.”The mess was spilling over into our family life. Robin had let meknow that kids at school were asking her why her dad hated the president. A schoolmate of Danjack’s had told him just the opposite—that he hoped I nailed the SOB.Despite allegations to the contrary, I wasn’t gunning for thepresident. I wasn’t gunning for anybody. What I was gunning forwas the truth. The problem was being ready to accept the personalconsequences that might ensue when I found it. Gut check.One night after supper, Jean and I were sitting at the kitchentable. We were having that kind of forthright conversation thathusbands and wives have when there’s a lot going on.Unquestionably, this was the best job I’d ever had. I loved what Iwas doing and thought I was doing good work, but times like theseoffer a cold, clear opportunity to second-guess yourself. Was itpossible that the in-house whisperers were right, that I was out toofar on the story? Or perhaps worse, did I have it right, but therewould be hell to pay? What would happen if the White House camedown full force on the network? Would I be the scapegoatsomehow?At some point, it wasn’t just about me. Jean and I had sloggedour way up from the bottom, but now there were car payments anda house note to meet, and kids’ schooling to pay. Now it was all onthe line. Unexpectedly, there was a silence, and we just looked ateach other. “Are we going to make it?” Jean asked quietly.I was taken aback by her question, but I surely understood whereshe was coming from. Jean, as always, is my best reality check. “Ofcourse we’re going to make it,” I replied. “We always make it.”“We have a lot at stake here,” she continued.“It’s true we have all our chips on the table,” I said. “Everything ison the line. Either I’m right about what I’m doing on this story, orvery soon I’m going to be doing something else for a living. I’ll beselling insurance or real estate.”Jean being Jean, our conversation ended with her saying, “I’mnot questioning what you’re doing, but I worry. You know, as you’vealways known, that I trust your judgment. I trust you, and I’mbehind you all the way.”That was all the reality I needed to hear. Senate Watergate hearings commenced in May 1973, right afterWhite House counsel John Dean was fired and Haldeman andEhrlichman resigned. I went over to the hearing to get a sense ofwhat was happening, but because my beat was the White House, Idid not go very often. In July, the existence of the White Housetaping system was revealed. I immediately thought back to mysession in Ehrlichman’s office and my suspicion that I was beingtaped. In hindsight, of course I was being taped. Every otherconversation in that office had been recorded, why not mine?As soon as the tapes’ existence became known, specialprosecutor Archibald Cox asked that they be subpoenaed. Nixonfought their release on the basis of national security. Meanwhile, thehearings continued; most of Nixon’s former staff was called beforeSam Ervin’s committee, including John Dean. The sessions weretelevised, and the nation was riveted by them. After Dean testifiedabout Nixon’s Enemies List, Dan Schorr was handed a copy. Schorrwas live as he read the list on camera and was amazed to speak hisown name aloud as No. 17: a “real media enemy.” Thereafter heclaimed that making the list was one of the greatest achievements ofhis career. (That particular list contained just 20 names. Eventuallywe learned that the White House had identified hundreds ofenemies, including me.)Nixon lost the battle to remain in office in stages. In April 1974,the White House tried to satisfy Judge John Sirica by releasingedited transcripts of some tapes and withholding others, but thattactic was rejected.One of my most poignant memories of the last days of Watergateis Julie Nixon Eisenhower’s impassioned 11th-hour defense of herfather. On May 7, 1974, Julie and her husband, David Eisenhower,met with reporters in the East Garden of the White House. Thebravery and loyalty of a daughter to confront the presidential presscorps and tell us that her father intended to take this“constitutionally down to the wire” was entirely admirable.To me, however, it was heartbreaking at the same time. By then,the facts had completely overwhelmed Richard Nixon. None of us inthe White House press corps thought there was any way that he could weather this crisis. To a man—and woman—we all werecertain that Richard Nixon would be driven from office or forced toresign. The only question remaining was when. We knew it was over.He knew it was over. Moreover, we knew that he was sitting in theOval Office, only a few yards away, as his daughter spoke. He wasallowing his child to defend the indefensible. I have a daughter, andI remember choking up and saying to myself, “Mr. President, for thelove of God, find an aide, somebody, to call her back inside. Don’t lether do this.”On May 9, 1974, formal impeachment proceedings began in theHouse of Representatives. In July, special prosecutor Leon Jaworskitook the matter to the Supreme Court. (Jaworski had replacedArchibald Cox after Nixon ordered Cox’s firing in October 1973.)On July 24, 1974, the court voted 8–0 to order the release of alltapes. (On the tape of January 3, 1972, Nixon is heard telling hisdaughter Tricia, “Rather’s a bastard.”)On August 5, the so-called “smoking gun” tape was made public.On the tape of June 23, 1972, less than a week after the Watergatebreak-in, Nixon’s voice is clearly audible as he instructed staff towork through the FBI and CIA to kill the investigation. This meantthat the president of the United States had ordered and activelyparticipated in a conspiracy to obstruct justice, an impeachableoffense.Nixon announced his resignation on August 8, 1974, effective thenext day, rather than face impeachment by the House and almostcertain conviction in the Senate. In the end, Senate Republicans,among them Barry Goldwater, played a decisive role. After therelease of the tapes, it was clear to them that Nixon was complicit. Itwas their duty to tell him that he would not be exonerated in theSenate.What a long and bizarre downfall it had been. If you had tried to tellme that there would be more than 40 members of thisadministration convicted of felonies, that the president himself wouldbe the ringleader of a widespread criminal conspiracy directed from the Oval Office, that there would be CIA operatives tapping phonesand breaking into houses, that there would be hush money paid anda guy using his wife’s dishwashing gloves so there wouldn’t be anyprints on the money, I’d have said that the odds were better ofseeing Fidel Castro riding through the Capitol Rotunda on a giraffe.The weird part is that it didn’t have to be. Nixon was going to winthe 1972 election, and he knew it. And he was going to win big. Hedidn’t need to break into the Watergate complex and spy on LarryO’Brien and the Democratic National Committee. He didn’t needDonald Segretti and his team of dirty tricksters (who, by the way,included a very young Karl Rove). This, however, is where Nixon’scynical and vindictive nature got the better of him. Winning, evenwinning big, wasn’t good enough. Nixon’s election to the presidencybrought him redemption. To his everlasting shame, once in office, heturned to revenge. Nixon came to believe that it was not sufficient tosimply defeat your opponents; it was necessary to destroy them,both individually and collectively. He had to crush the Democrats,and to do so he resorted to extreme and illegal measures.What happened after the break-in was so much more extremethan the worst I could possibly have imagined at the time the storyfirst broke. This was not just the true believers in the White Housegoing beyond their brief. Richard Nixon directed them—stopping onlyjust shy of murder. In fact, it was only the arrests at Watergate thatderailed the White House plumbers in their plot to assassinate JackAnderson. To call them “plumbers” is to place a benign andsomewhat humorous nickname on what was really an insidious,malicious gang of felons. The plumbers were a highly skilled grouptrained in the political black arts—wiretapping, home break-ins, useof federal agencies like the IRS and FBI against personal “enemies,”and beyond—a paramilitary group recruited by the White Houseexpressly for this purpose. This may sound like harsh judgment, butit is indeed supported by the facts.Revisionist history has blurred the edges of the national memoryof what happened. People not yet born, or not old enough toremember the early to mid 1970s, may be tempted to think thatWatergate was just another political scandal. It was not. This was a constitutional crisis of the first order. The president was runningwhat was, in effect, a crime syndicate from the Oval Office.There have been many theories put forward about why Nixon didwhat he did. Many of them delve into armchair psychology,hypothesizing a sense of inferiority about his childhood, which begathis huge resentment of the Kennedys and all that they represented.(Following Neil Armstrong’s “one small step” on the moon in July1969, the watchword in NASA became “on to Mars.” Instead, Nixoncut the space program off at the ankles. The reason? He saw it as aKennedy program, not an American program. It took a great deal ofconvincing for him to go forward into space with even a minimaleffort. The only project he kept was what was billed as a “spacetruck”—the space shuttle.)The idea that Nixon was somehow less than responsible for whathe did because he came up the poor way doesn’t wash. There aremillions of Americans who have risen above underprivilegedchildhoods who didn’t end up running a crime syndicate, let aloneone that operated out of the highest office in the land. Make nomistake: Nixon was not a victim. He was a perpetrator. The onlyreason he was anunindicted co-conspirator was because prosecutorJaworski told the grand jury that on constitutional grounds, indictinga sitting president should be left to the Senate.Watergate left the country reeling. Beyond its immediate damage,however, are its lingering toxic effects. Nixon injected the vindictiveand malignant virus of “win and demolish” into the American bodypolitic, where it has taken root and proliferated. It still flourishestoday.Four decades later, however, the memory of what happened hasfaded, and two generations of Americans have little or no inklingwhat Watergate was about. The public at large may have forgottenwhat happened during that time, but Nixon’s people never did. Inthe aftermath, there was not a lot of contrition among theparticipants, not even among those who did time. Worse yet, theyheld CBS, and me, along with theWashington Post, responsible forwhat happened, and that animosity carried through into the Reaganand Bush presidencies. Elephants, it seems, never forget. CHAPTER 6 Presidents I Have Known, Part IIWhen Nixon won in 1968, I had wondered whether CBS wouldrotate me off covering the presidency, but the answer had comeback no, they wanted me to remain. Now, barely a few weeks intoGerald Ford’s administration, Dick Salant asked if I would leave mypost as chief White House correspondent and take a new position asanchor-correspondent forCBS Reports. CBS Reports, however,originated from New York.By that time, I had covered the White House for a decade, whichwas a considerably longer stint than usual. I myself had chosen tostay on after the transition from Johnson to Nixon. The idea ofleaving in 1972, between Nixon’s first and second terms, wasrejected out of hand. “Whatever you may be thinking,” Dick Salanthad told me at the time, “you have to stay. We can’t be in theposition of appearing to yield to White House pressure.” (For therecord, I felt the same way.)Now that Ford was president, Salant went to great lengths toconvince not only the public but me as well that this reassignmentwas a promotion. I was not convinced. Ed Murrow had madelandmark documentaries, first onSee It Now, then later onCBSReports before being pushed out. The show’s title had since becomean umbrella for network documentaries in general, but the formathad languished. What message were they sending by making me theanchor of a show that had no regular spot on the schedule?I suspected that the move might have been precipitated by anexchange I’d had six months earlier with Richard Nixon. In March1974 at a presidential press conference before the NationalAssociation of Broadcasters, I’d stood up to ask Richard Nixon aquestion and was greeted with a mixed chorus of cheers and boos.Although that spontaneous reaction pretty accurately reflectedthe diversity of public opinion over our reporting on Watergate, I suspected that a number of the boos might have come from our ownCBS affiliates, especially those from the Deep South. Some localstation owners were hostile because they were Nixon supporters;others objected because our coverage of the Watergate hearingswas cutting into ad revenues from daytime programming, especiallysoap operas.Before I could ask my question, Nixon, as surprised by thehubbub as I was, asked me one of his own: “Are you running forsomething, Mr. Rather?”“No sir, Mr. President,” I replied quickly. “Are you?” Thatinstantaneous reflex response probably would not have kicked upany dust at all, except that I was the one who had made it, andRichard Nixon was already much besieged. In the wake of theexchange, Dick Salant received a barrage of letters criticizing me forbeing disrespectful to the president and demanding myreassignment.Now it was late August 1974, and rumors were flying that I wasbeing called back to New York because I had become the poster boyfor animosity between the White House and the press. It was a verylow period for me. Some southern station managers were actuallytaking credit for pulling strings to effect my relocation. The movewas also difficult for me personally. Because our children were intheir last years of high school, uprooting them would have beenmuch too disruptive. I got a small apartment in New York andcommuted to DC for family time on weekends.Once I got to work, however, I wasn’t in News Div headquartersin the old milk barn. TheCBS Reports offices were blocks away inanother building entirely. Although long-form journalism suited me, itstill felt like I’d been shunted up and aside. Iced. About a year later,however, I was given yet another assignment. In December 1975, Imade my first appearance as a correspondent on60 Minutes. Theprogram had just been moved to its 7:00 p.m. time slot. Theofficially stated reason was so that it could better stay clear ofprofessional football overtime, which had been newly instituted.Some on60 Minutes suspected that people in the EntertainmentDivision of CBS moved it there in hopes that it would die off in the more competitive prime time “fringe” of 7:00 p.m. (If so, little didthe Entertainment guys know that this would be the making of60Minutes as we know it.)FordThe 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which deals withpresidential succession, was ratified in 1967. The first three times itwas invoked all involved Gerald Ford. Ford was appointed vicepresident in October 1973 upon the resignation of Spiro Agnew aftercharges of bribery and tax evasion. He ascended to the presidency inAugust 1974 upon the resignation of Richard Nixon. In December1974, Nelson Rockefeller was appointed as Ford’s VP.Gerald Ford was a genial fellow, easy to be around, and he gotalong extremely well with reporters. The press loved President Fordin no small measure because he wasn’t Richard Nixon. Ford alreadyhad some media skills that he’d honed as House minority leader. Heknew who was who in the press corps, who represented what, andwho needed what. He also made himself accessible. Correspondentswere a bit easier on him than they could have been, both becausehe took over the presidency when the country was aching for somestability and peace and quiet, and because it was acknowledged thathe was a caretaker president.Ford was truly humbled by the presidency—after all, the onlyconstituents who had ever voted him into office were the folks inand around Grand Rapids, Michigan. In a way, he was a bit like aclub-level prizefighter who suddenly found himself in a title match.He was aware that the Watergate crisis had badly fragmented thecountry and that it needed to be pulled together, to heal. Towardthat end, he used the media in his efforts to soften and elevate thepublic’s negative view of the presidency and generally presentedhimself with great humility and self-effacing humor. To salve thewounds of Watergate, he deliberately showed us the human face ofthe man in the office. He allowed himself to be seen making toastand that sort of thing. Ford was Everyman as president. That said, he will always be best remembered for his pardon ofRichard Nixon. The grand jury had already named Nixon as anunindicted co-conspirator, but literally a month after taking over aspresident, Ford issued a blanket pardon, thus ensuring that Nixonwould never have to answer under oath for what he had done,either before a jury or in the Senate of the United States. Because itwas a presidential pardon, nobody could do anything about it. Wesay we’re a people who want accountability for elected officials, butfrom that point forward, Nixon would never be held accountable.Although he projected an image of being a regular guy, I don’tthink Ford acted out of bravery or any sense of nobility. I said asmuch the night he announced the pardon, and I have believed eversince that there was a deal in place when Ford became vicepresident after Agnew resigned in disgrace. I believe Nixon choseFord in October 1973 because implicitly or explicitly he alreadyunderstood how vulnerable he was. The noose was tightening. Nixonwas still hoping against hope that he would slide through, but hewas also a realist. At some point the question would have beenasked, “If worse comes to worst, whom can I depend on?”And I believe to this day that there was a deal, explicit or implicit,in place at the time Nixon resigned. If Nixon had gone to trial, hewould have been convicted. If impeachment proceedings had beenissued against him, he would have been impeached. Ford was atough partisan fighter and a decent guy, but he understood that inpolitics, you can’t always be decent, and you can’t always play bythe rules.But it cost him. Jerald terHorst, who had covered Ford for theDetroit News for two decades, became press secretary when Fordbecame president in August 1974. In September, immediately afterFord issued the pardon, terHorst tendered his resignation becausehe could not in good conscience defend the pardon to the press andto the public.Ford ran for election against Jimmy Carter in 1976. If Watergatehad not happened, or even if Watergate had not been fully exposed,a case could be made that the Republicans might have won the1976 election, but Carter came virtually out of nowhere and defeated Ford. The pardon certainly helped doom Ford’s chances tobe elected in his own right.CarterPresident Carter became a favorite of the press during the 1976presidential campaign because he was something new. Johnson waspure Texas to the core, but that is different from being a Southerner.Carter sounded exactly like Georgia; more than that, he surroundedhimself with people from Georgia.In the beginning, he and the members of his new administrationtried very hard to be different. Worse, Carter made a point of sayingthat different was better. He was certain that those fresh, beyondthe Beltway Georgia voices were exactly what the country needed.The downside of that posture was that instead of embracingRepublican and Democratic insiders, he stayed aloof.Payback for Carter, as it is for so many in politics, was a bitch.After he walled off the DC establishment, they walled him off inretribution, which meant Carter couldn’t get anything done. Thatbecame the central problem of his presidency. He was as tone deafabout the levers of power in Washington as Johnson was adept.Over and above bringing in his loyal but inexperienced campaignpeople to fill high positions in the administration, what he neededwas a really good insider—a Beltway pit bull—to be his White Housechief of staff.That would have made him much more effective in getting hisagenda through Congress, but Carter vowed never to be part of theWashington elite and tried to sell that to the press. The press knewbetter and was having none of it. “Excuse me, Mr. President, but byvirtue of the office you hold, you are the ultimate Washingtoninsider.”Those two elements pretty much decided how he was received.There was a testy side to Carter, and it would flash from time totime. By mid-presidency the press wasn’t actively hostile to him, butthe honeymoon was certainly over. Carter was unquestionably a smart guy. Although he campaignedas the peanut farmer from Plains, he had graduated from Annapolisand trained as a nuclear engineer. That engineer mentality didn’tnecessarily serve him well. He loved being involved in the details, tothe point of getting entangled by minutiae that should have beendelegated to staff. That said, given any standard IQ test, he wouldprobably score competitively with two of our brightest contemporarypresidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama—perhaps higher, becauseCarter was so strong in math and physics.One of the first interviews I did with President Carter made itclear that he was a very bright guy who wanted to appear as anhonest, sincere person with the country’s best interests at heart. Hedid, however, let himself go much too far in his “just folks” candor. Atthe suggestion of my producer, Steve Glauber, I asked him to gradehimself as a president. A shrewder or more wily politician might havereplied, “That’s for other people to do.” But Carter was into honesty,so he went down the line and actually answered the question.“Let’s see. On domestic policy, I’d give myself a C plus. I’mgetting better on foreign policy, but I think I’ve only shown a Cthere. On economics, I’d give myself a B.” He added a few more butstayed very modest.I wanted to give him a way out, but by that time he had built hisown trap. “Mr. President,” I said, “by my calculations the average is aC plus.” He was stunned. He certainly did not want to be a C-pluspresident, but he had graded himself. The interview went downhillfrom there.One of the more endearing things about covering the WhiteHouse is that each administration brings at least a tinge of theculture from which it comes. From Harry Truman forward, you didnot smell whiskey anywhere in the White House at any time—not tosay that people didn’t drink in there, they surely did. LyndonJohnson drank, not excessively by the way. Johnson always said tointerviewers and others that he drank bourbon and branch water,which is a western expression. Fact is, however, he had a taste forScotch, and most of the time that’s what he drank. I don’t think Carter himself ever drank, but he had surroundedhimself with some very talented good ole boys who had a penchantfor elbow-bending. I remember walking into the Oval Office andgetting just the faint, faint smell of bourbon wafting on the air, asmell I do know something about. I remember smiling and saying tomyself, “That’s kind of nice, actually.” It made me feel a little betterabout these drawling southern guys.During the 1980 campaign, it didn’t take a political reporter tosurmise that at the very least, Carter was going to have a toughtime with Reagan. It wasn’t in him to believe that, however. Perhapsmore poignantly, it wasn’t in Mrs. Carter to believe it, either. The twoof them were sure, right up to the very end, that they were going towin. They convinced themselves; hope is father to belief.As the elections approached, the Friday polls showed a deadheat. Having covered politics for a long time, I am aware that manyfolks don’t make up their minds until the last minute, and there isoften a shift over the last weekend before the voting begins onTuesday. In a close race, that shift decides the election. I do thinkthat if not for the hostage situation in Iran, Carter might have beenable to pull out a victory over Reagan.ReaganWhen Ronald Reagan first vied for the Republican nomination in1980, the Washington press corps was initially very skeptical abouthis chances. He had sought the nomination twice previously. Thefirst time was in 1968, when he lost out to Richard Nixon. He put hishat in the ring again in 1976 and again lost out, that time toappointed president Gerald Ford. In 1980, however, he secured thenomination and went on to unseat incumbent president JimmyCarter.Reagan enjoyed a good relationship with the White House presscorps and was at ease with them. As a TV and movie veteran, heknew how to use the media to great advantage. As we say in Texas,he had been to that rodeo many times. He was comfortable in his own skin, always ready with a quip or a joke, which was invaluable.Although not a scholar, he had outstanding people skills. Reagan hada wonderful sense of humor and never seemed to get mad atanyone. (Or if he did, he never let it show.)He sometimes used the press as a foil. When he departed theWhite House for Marine One, he left enough distance so you wouldhave to shout a question to him. ABC’s Sam Donaldson made awhole career of shouting what became known as “the helicopterquestion” to the president.The Reagan White House was skillful at managing photo ops forthe president, and indeed at managing the press in general. DeputyChief of Staff Michael Deaver often handled that responsibility,ensuring that whatever Reagan had to say had what they termed“good visuals” behind it. Their prevailing view was that the imageReagan projected on television was at least as important as what hehad to say.Reagan took office less than two months before I took over fromWalter Cronkite at theCBS Evening News. In 1980, Walter had madethe decision he wanted to leave the anchor chair and go out on top.He told me I was his choice to succeed him, for which I was deeplyappreciative. When I came to the anchor chair in March 1981, heremained as supportive and encouraging as he had been earlier inmy career. One of my first goals was to get an interview with RonaldReagan. I talked with my longtime friend, White Housecorrespondent Bill Plante, whose job it became to get theanchorman an interview with the new president. When the processof getting it set up seemed to be taking longer than it should have, Iasked Bill what was going on. “Well, they’re pretty choosy,” he said,“and they’re not too sure of you. Reagan’s people are pretty hard-core conservative Republicans, and they’re of the ilk that sees mostpeople at CBS as left-wing liberals. You included.”Elephants never forget.Several members of Reagan’s press team had been in the NixonWhite House. What they learned in the interim, however, was to bemore clever at disguising their contempt for the press and far moresubtle at managing coverage. Finally an interview was set up, an hour-long session of the sortthat isn’t much done anymore. We had agreed at the start thatsomewhere about the halfway mark, we would pause for five or tenminutes to give both of us a break. Shortly before that, I had askedthe president about race, and he had replied.In general, I thought the session was going well, but MichaelDeaver, the White House image-maker in chief, apparently wasunhappy with the answer Reagan had given to the race question.During the break, Reagan himself took me aside. “Dan, on that lastquestion I didn’t respond as well as I wanted to,” he said. “I’m notasking you not to use it, and I will understand if you say no, butwhen we resume, if we could revisit that subject, or if you could aska follow-up question that would give me an opportunity to betterexpress what I really feel, I would appreciate it.”There was nothing whatsoever threatening or unpleasant abouthis tone. Reagan could be tough, but one-on-one, there was agentleness about him that was impressive. “I’ll certainly considerthat seriously, Mr. President,” I replied. When we resumed, but notright away, I asked him another question on the subject, and hegave a gentler, more expansive answer. As I recall, when we editedthe tape, we left both responses in the segment.I thought the interview was very good and we played it in primetime, with the enthusiastic support of CBS executives. Shortly afterthe interview was broadcast, Bill Plante told several CBS executivesthat Reagan was not displeased with the interview, but that he didn’tfeel any particular chemistry with me. Reagan was a big believer inpersonal chemistry. I had felt very comfortable during the interviewand I thought he did, too, so I thought that his comment seemedrather curious. The interview did not get rave reviews, but it didn’tget blasted either. The later interviews with Reagan seemed equallycomfortable for me and for him. Although I did not agree with all ofhis decisions, I liked him. I never believed President Reagan waspersonally racially prejudiced, but he wasn’t as sensitive as heshould have been about race relations. In particular, he did not seemto realize how some elements of the Republican Party tried to exploitracial conflict as a wedge issue for partisan advantage. There were many positives to the Reagan presidency, but his being a leader forimproving race relations was not one of them.Reagan really earned the plaudits that came with the handle “theGreat Communicator.” There was something very disarming aboutthe way Reagan presented himself, both in his demeanor andespecially in his tone of voice. It played, I believe, a significant rolein his ability to avoid being implicated in Iran-Contra, which waspotentially as impeachable an offense as Watergate, if not more so.He was indeed the Teflon president.Reagan was a good combination of optimism and pragmatism.We talk a lot about the power of the American presidency. Thatpower has many facets, but one of the most important, and in myopinion the most overlooked, is the power to persuade. This poweris right at the core of the power of the presidency—the power topersuade Congress, and even more important the power to persuadethe American people. And Reagan was masterful at it.He was a superb speaker. Like a good actor, he knew how andwhen to pause in his delivery and when to emphasize a key word orphrase. Yes, they called him “the Great Communicator,” but part ofwhat made that possible was that he was a Great Deliverer.Time and again he demonstrated that he had the right things tosay and that he could say them in the right way. Yes, he had goodspeechwriters, among the best that any president has had, and yes,he worked off a script for his most important speeches. PeggyNoonan wrote extensively for him; Reagan did not write a lot of hisown speeches. He wrote more than either Bush I or II, who wrotealmost none of theirs.What is overlooked, I believe, is that Reagan was very good attelling his speechwriters what concept he wanted to get across.Beyond that, he was emotionally engaged in taking responsibility forthe content of the speech. After he’d been given the draft of thespeech, he’d read through it aloud, write his own notes in themargins and edit it till he was comfortable with it. What he had tosay and the way he said it resonated with the public, even withthose who disagreed with him, and that’s no small accomplishment. Bush IThe term of George Herbert Walker Bush was in many ways the thirdterm of Ronald Reagan. By the time he took office in 1989, he hadone of the longest résumés in the Republican Party, having servedeight years as Reagan’s vice president, and before that asambassador to the United Nations, Republican National Committeechair, and congressman from the Seventh District in Texas(Houston). He was also director of the CIA during the final year ofGerald Ford’s presidency.Bush is perhaps best remembered for facing down SaddamHussein in the Gulf War, after Saddam had attempted to take controlof the oilfields in neighboring Kuwait. In January 1991, Bush orderedthe aerial assault on Iraqi troops, followed by the introduction ofground forces about a month later. After routing the Iraqis fromKuwait, Bush gave the order to stand down. His popularity soaredbecause of the successful military operation, but many peopleremained puzzled by his decision not to push forward into Iraq andoverthrow Saddam Hussein, especially since the Iraqi Army was infull retreat and the road to Baghdad was wide open. Bush explainedby saying that overthrowing Saddam would have generated heavycasualties and expense and that “we would have been forced tooccupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq.” I think that it was amistake, and when his son went into Baghdad, part of the reasonwas to repair his father’s error.I had always gotten along well with Bush Senior, and with Mrs.Bush as well. We had Houston in common. They were adoptiveTexans out of Connecticut, having moved to Houston at the end ofthe Eisenhower years. I was a local boy made good, and we gotalong fine—at least until I interviewed him in January 1988. Bushwas still vice president. He was gearing up to run for president, buthis nomination was far from assured. Other contenders included BobDole of Kansas and Jack Kemp of New York.The interview got off on the wrong foot immediately. As soon as Iasked Bush a question about his role in Iran-Contra, he threw the issue of my six minutes of dead air back at me.Dead air in Miami. This is one of those incidents that has stuck tome like a wad of old chewing gum on the bottom of my shoe. Lessthan four months earlier, I had left the set because we’d been put onnotice that a semifinal tennis match at Forest Hills between SteffiGraf and Lori McNeil was going to run long. CBS Sports was carryingthe broadcast, and they had let us know they would stay with thematch to the end. We were set to go on the air at 6:30 with specialcoverage of the arrival of Pope John Paul II in Miami to begin hishistoric visit to the United States. We had a tightly scripted half hour,and the first we’d heard about the tennis problem was about 18minutes before airtime. If we were going to have an abbreviatedbroadcast, we would need some time to determine how to cut itdown. And of course, until the match ended, there was no way toknow how much time we’d actually have. The only way to buy timeto figure it out was to have CBS Sports stay on the air at theconclusion of the match.Let me be clear: I did not walk off the set in a snit. Was Iunhappy that tennis was being allowed to preempt the pope?Absolutely. I thought it set a very bad precedent, in effect tellingviewers that sports was more important than news. But going toblack is one of the great cardinal sins in broadcasting and notsomething I would have done just to make a statement. Not ever.As we got closer to airtime, what I said—several times—was, “Iftennis isn’t off and you don’t come to us at 6:30, don’t come to us.I’ll be in place, ready at 6:30, but not immediately after that if ournewscast doesn’t start. Give us a chance to regroup and getourselves together. Have Sports hold it until we can know what we’redoing.”I was in the chair at 6:30 but was told that the tennis match wasstill going on. Since I thought the plan was clear, I unhooked myselfand went out of the studio. I understood that CBS Sports was stillrunning the show. Sports understood no such thing. When thematch ended at 6:33, Sports put us into black. There was no wrap-up, they just tossed the broadcast to News. This was not anyone’s finest hour. Within both the Sports Divisionand the News Division, there was surely enough blame to go aroundamong executives, producers and directors. Some of it belonged tome, but I was urged to hold my peace and let our corporatespinmeisters deal with damage control. Their way of doing that wasto lay the incident squarely at my feet.Which is exactly where George H. W. Bush picked it up, like abrickbat, during our interview.Bush’s use of the dead-air incident was a red herring meant toderail any further questioning from me about his role in Iran-Contra,but there was nothing accidental about his doing so. His mediacampaign consultant, Roger Ailes, was in the studio with him,holding up cue cards out of camera range, telling him what to say.(Ailes today is president of Fox News.)The vice president and I had a contentious and confrontationalnine minutes. I asked what I thought were the right questions butgot very little of substance in response. As soon as I got off the air, Irealized that he had never answered the Iran-Contra questions.Bush’s spokesman later termed my questions about Iran-Contra an“ambush,” saying that the campaign had no expectation that thesubject would be raised during the interview. This is about asplausible as Captain Renault being shocked,shocked that there isgambling going on in Rick’s Café during the movieCasablanca. Thenetwork had promo-ed the Bush interview for several days, makingthe particular point that Iran-Contra would be on the docket. If theBush campaign was unaware of our intentions, they had spent agreat deal of time down the rabbit hole.At the end of the interview, the CBS phone lines lit up with callsfrom irate individuals complaining that I had rudely hectored andbrowbeaten the vice president and that I deserved to be strung upfor it, or words to that effect. I asked Jean whether I shouldapologize. “Don’t you dare!” she replied. Eventually we learned thatmany of the calls came from Republican phone banks that had beenset up across the country—set up in advance, for exactly thatpurpose. Ambush indeed. My interview with George Bush made the news, but the reportingthat night and the following morning focused on the kerfuffle, not onwhether Bush really had been “out of the loop” on Iran-Contra. Thesound bite that was broadcast over and over featured Bush asking,“How would you like it if I judged your career by those sevenminutes when you walked off the set in New York?”It was six minutes, not seven, and Miami, not New York, but Iwas in the eye of one of those media maelstroms that had quicklytaken on a life of its own. For the moment, the truth scarcelymattered. I had asked a serious question about a scandal thatinvolved backdoor funding of a clandestine effort to overthrow aforeign government, the deliberate breach of a law passed byCongress expressly to prohibit this activity, the sale of arms to anenemy nation in exchange for the release of hostages and a patternof lying about it afterward. Much like an aircraft carrier under attackin the open ocean, Bush had responded by laying down asmokescreen. His retort about the dead-air incident was an effort toequate Iran-Contra, which involved significant impeachable offenses,with something far more petty.Bush was obviously very proud of his macho performance. “It waslike combat. Bastard didn’t lay a glove on me,” he crowed the nextday, thinking his microphone had been turned off. “He makes LesleyStahl look like a pussy.”Elephants never forget.The incident certainly provided more fodder for those who wereconvinced that Dan Rather really had it in for the Republicans, butjournalists of integrity ask questions. Especially when an interviewsubject is involved with allegations of serious wrongdoing in publicoffice, and especially when that individual is a candidate for thepresidency, journalists have a responsibility to ask the hard questionsand to keep on asking them until the subject answers, or until it isclear he refuses to answer.It took a while for the dust to settle and for it to becomeapparent to more people than just me that the vice president hadnever answered my question. As was later made clear, however,Bush definitely was vulnerable on the issue. Although he repeated his contention that he was “out of the loop,” at the very end of histerm Bush pardoned six officials prominently implicated in Iran-Contra, including former secretary of defense Caspar Weinbergerand former assistant secretary of state Elliott Abrams. Several werepardoned before they came to trial, hence before they wereconvicted of any wrongdoing. After those pardons and after theinauguration of Bill Clinton, Bush turned over his 1986 diary toindependent prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, a diary whose existence hehad denied for many years.And in a way, Ailes’s tactic worked. This incident remains a classicexample of the trivialization of the news.A year before the dead air episode, something else happened to methat also got far more attention than was warranted. In the fall of1986, I was mugged by a stranger on New York’s Park Avenue. Theassailant escaped after sucker punching me from behind. Who hewas and why he had attacked me remained a mystery for almost 10years. His identity was not discovered until 1994, when he fatallyshot an NBC technician outside theToday show studios. WilliamTager confessed to that murder, and in the process confessed thathe had also assaulted me. The NYPD and the district attorney’soffice confirmed that he unquestionably was my attacker; whenquestioned, he related details that only he and I could know.Apparently Tager had also planned additional armed assaults onother media personalities, but had failed to carry them out. Thereason he gave for the assaults was puzzling, if not downrightbizarre. Tager was convinced that the media had him undersurveillance and was relentlessly beaming hostile messages to him.As he attacked me, he demanded that I tell him the frequency beingused to transmit these messages. The statute of limitationsprohibited his being prosecuted for assaulting me, but William Tagerwas convicted of murdering the NBC technician and is serving a longprison sentence. My biggest regret is that he wasn’t caught beforehe killed someone. ClintonBill Clinton first came on my radar screen when he was a very youngman, having become the governor of Arkansas at the age of 32.When I had breezed through Arkansas prior to the election, he wasthe talk of the state. It was clear even then that he had presidentialaspirations, and I knew not to bet against him. His time as governorwas initially rocky; he was defeated in his first bid for reelection butcame back and was reelected four times thereafter.Sometime in the 1980s, a friend of ours told me offhandedly thather friend, Arkansas governor Bill Clinton, would be visiting NewYork, and that she’d like for Jean and me to meet him. She didn’tsay so, but implicit in her invitation was the idea that Clinton was apolitical comer, which I already knew.We met up on a hot New York Saturday afternoon at the cornerof Madison and 82nd Street, then strolled for a little bit to a localplace that specialized in different beers. We had a livelyconversation, and I came away impressed with Clinton. Hillary waswith him, but very quiet and very much in the background. Surely noone thinks of her that way anymore.When Clinton won the Democratic nomination in 1992, George H.W. Bush was favored; the incumbent president generally has theadvantage. Bush, however, ran a terrible campaign. Among his othergaffes, he got caught flatfooted in a supermarket, marveling at thisnewfangled device called a scanner, something that homemakershad known about for years. It surely pegged him as out of touchwith regular folks.It was the entry of upstart populist billionaire Ross Perot,however, that helped create the conditions for Clinton’s election.Perot’s platform was a mixed bag of liberal, moderate andconservative positions and included a balanced budget, gun control,an end to job outsourcing and a pro-choice stance on abortion. Inthe end, Perot siphoned off more votes from Bush than he did fromClinton. If Perot had not been in the race, it is likely that Bush wouldhave been reelected. As president, Bill Clinton had a terrific relationship with the press,despite the fact that he got off to a very difficult start. He wasperhaps the first president to have literally no honeymoon period. Assoon as he took office, he proposed health-care reforms—soundfamiliar?—but ran into a tsunami of lobbying and opposition from theother side. His first term never really recovered from that. When theRepublicans took the House in 1994 with Newt Gingrich and his“Contract with America,” Clinton regrouped. There was a persistencemarried to resiliency in Clinton throughout his political career. Hetook stock, made changes and was reelected in 1996, defeating BobDole. Much of his second term, of course, was bogged down in theMonica Lewinsky scandal. Despite the fact that under Clinton thecountry was both prosperous and peaceful, the scandal and theensuing investigation and impeachment stopped his presidency in itstracks. His second term in office could have carried with it a dazzlingarray of new directions and possibilities. Instead, it was one longreplay of the Lewinsky affair. Arguably, however, he has been one ofthe best and most influential retired presidents in history.I got along well with him; we only had one uncomfortable time,and that was the exit interview as he was leaving the presidency.There had been a lot of competition as to who was going to ask thequestions, and finally I was selected. I conducted the interview andallowed him to talk about his successes as president, but then I hadone question and one follow-up about the Monica Lewinsky affairand Mrs. Clinton’s reaction. I basically said, “You’ve gone through allof that and it’s behind you. You’ve had time to reflect on it. Anythoughts?”It was really a softball question, at least I thought it was, but hedidn’t hear it that way. He let me know after the interview that hedid not appreciate it, but I think he was naïve to expect that wewere going to cover his entire presidency and not deal with the affairand the impeachment threat. His reaction showed me that thewounds were still raw, both his own and Hillary’s as well.Bush II The most important aspects of my relationship with George W. Bushhave become public knowledge and have already been covered atlength here. The last time I was in his presence was shortly afterwe’d gone through what we can call “the Bush case.” Every yearbefore the State of the Union address, Bush would host a lunch for asmall group of reporters from the major networks and wire services.This was a tradition many presidents observed. The lunch included apreview of the State of the Union and offered us a chance to ask afew questions.In 2005, I was invited. I was not sure I wanted to go, but I wascurious about what he would say in this State of the Union address.I asked two lightweight questions, and he gave easy answers. As wewere all leaving, Bush came up and wished me well and expressedthe hope that I would have a good retirement in Texas.Perhaps a good way to look at Bush II is to compare his approachto problems with that of his father. Although only 12 years separatethe beginnings of their presidencies, they are light years apart inhow they handled the office. Bush I, for example, would no soonerallow his vice president to equal him—or even near equal him—inbehind-the-scenes power than he would do a half-gainer off theEmpire State Building. His vice president was Dan Quayle. Eventhough I never thought Quayle was as dumb as he was presented inthe press, he knew his role and played it quietly.Contrast that with Vice President Cheney. Dick Cheney was no“spare tire,” which is how Quayle was often described. On thecontrary, he was at least the assistant president, and there wasnothing quiet about the role he played. In fact, Cheney was thedriving power of the Bush II administration.Bush I had quite a bit of legislative experience—he had been inCongress for some time and had been vice president under RonaldReagan for eight years. His son had zero experience in legislativeprocesses. Equally clearly, he had zero interest in legislation.Bush I was curious about everything (which is one sign of a goodmind, I think). Bush II seemed to have little curiosity about anythingother than baseball. Bush I held his own views, but he was alwayssearching for common ground with his opponents for the good of the country. There was very little of that in his son. Bush I inheriteda shaky economy and worked with Republicans and Democrats aliketo bring it back under control. Bush II inherited a surplus and abalanced budget. Under the guise of being a fiscal and socialconservative, Bush II very nearly spent the country into oblivion, inparticular on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.George H. W. Bush had been forged in the fires of war. Heenlisted in the Navy on his 18th birthday and got his wings as WorldWar II’s youngest naval aviator just days before he turned 19. Whileserving in the Pacific, he was at the stick of his torpedo plane on abombing run against a radio station when he was hit by antiaircraftfire. Despite severe damage to the plane, he “continued his plungetoward the target” before bailing out. For his bravery, he wasawarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. He has said that hisexperiences in wartime gave him what he called a “soberingunderstanding” of the human cost of war. In contrast, Bush II hasoften been accused of leading the country rashly into war without agood understanding of cost, either in blood or in treasure. The factthat neither he nor his very powerful vice president ever saw combatis, I think, a contributing factor.Bush I had some semblance of respect for the role of the press ina democratic society. I don’t want to say that Bush II had no respectfor the press’s role, but more often his administration used it as ameans to advance their own political and ideological agenda.ObamaShepard Fairey’s iconic campaign poster from 2008 showed theimage of Barack Obama with the word “HOPE” underneath. In therun-up to the election, Obama built a glowing bonfire of hope andtied it to the message “Change You Can Believe In.” Much of theelectorate believed that his would be a transformative presidency,one that would indeed effect the changes our society so badlyneeded. The expectation turned out to be way too high. At a time whenmost expected the economy to take center stage, Obama turned tohealth-care reform instead. I believe that it was a mistake. I think itwas also a mistake to remain convinced that he could do businesswith the other side, despite all evidence to the contrary.You have to give the Republicans credit for being well organizedand well disciplined. They made it clear from day one that their toppriority was to make Obama a one-term president, and they said asmuch, out loud and often. Nevertheless, Obama continued trying tomake Washington work in a conciliatory, bipartisan way. One cancertainly argue that that is the way Washingtonought to work, butin the attempt, Obama negotiated away meaningful portions of hisagenda, perhaps unnecessarily, and in the process alienated many ofthose who had elected him.The message he put forward was, “I really am a nice guy. I reallydo care about the country, and I really do want to do business.” Noone should have been surprised by this approach. This is how he gotto be editor of theHarvard Law Review. This is how he has made itin life and politics this far. He really is a nice guy who is open tocompromise. He is a smart guy with good character, intellectuallyand emotionally ready to be president. On paper, as a package, helooks like presidential material.His mistake was in underestimating the adversarial determinationand solidarity of the Republicans. Most of them think he is too farleft. Some even think he is a socialist, a Communist, a Muslim. Thisname-calling is untrue, but when has truth ever been a useful tool inpolitics?On foreign policy, Obama gets pretty high marks in my book. Hisselection of Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state was bold andcontroversial, but she has been good. Staying with the decision toaggressively pursue Osama bin Laden was another importantdecision, and he deserves credit for that, too.I think that he has put some good people around him, but not inthe area he needed the most help—the economy. He has dependedupon the same old clique of economists—the Wall Street bigcorporation guys—who have not had the answers to help our sluggish economy and unemployment disasters. Obama ran astrong, successful presidential campaign in 2008. If his reelectiondrive succeeds, I hope that he will open the windows in the WhiteHouse and let the fresh, new talents of the 21st century come intohis administration. CHAPTER 7Washington, London, VietnamBut we just got here!”Jean was understandably exasperated at the prospect ofrelocating again so soon. Late in 1964 I came home with the newsthat we were moving to London; I was to become London bureauchief. Less than 12 months earlier, we had pulled up stakes to movefrom Houston to Washington when I had been named chief WhiteHouse correspondent. This next assignment meant that ourdaughter, Robin, would be enrolling in yet another first-grade class ina single school year—her third—and this time overseas, no less.Frankly, I was more than a little surprised when I got the word,but the London posting was not negotiable. Fred Friendly had justbecome president of CBS News, and Fred had very firm ideas aboutwhat he wanted. I did not know him when he worked with EdMurrow, but long before becoming head of the News Division, hehad been Murrow’s producer for many years. Fred had producedboth the hard-hitting 1954See It Now segments that helpedprecipitate Joseph McCarthy’s downfall and the landmark 1960CBSReports documentary “Harvest of Shame,” exposing the plight ofmigrant farmworkers.Murrow aside, by now Fred was pretty much a legend in his ownright. He was a big bear of a man, both in physical appearance andin demeanor, which meant he tended to dominate any landscapethat he occupied. He was passionate about his work and demanded excellence from everyone, including himself. He wouldn’t takeanything less than his best work, or yours.CBS was still chasing NBC in news ratings, and Friendly had theidea that someone better known than I was should be covering theWhite House. And by someone better known, he meant HarryReasoner. At the time, Harry was seen as a possible successor toWalter Cronkite in the anchor chair. Harry was a writer by nature,and had a writerly heart and writerly ways, which meant he took alot of time off. Fred thought that Harry was an underutilized asset,and the way he chose to get more work out of Harry was to makehim chief White House correspondent.As for me, getting assigned to London felt a bit like exile. It was aletdown, especially since I thought I’d done a pretty good jobcovering the 1964 elections, in which Lyndon Johnson trouncedBarry Goldwater. Was I being punished somehow? Fred, however,called me himself to cushion the blow. He told me straight out aboutthe need to give Harry a higher profile. He also reaffirmed thatsending me overseas was part of a larger network plan for me. I wasstill on the grow, and Fred wanted to develop me as what he calleda “complete correspondent.” To complete that transformation, heinsisted that I be based in London for at least two years.“If you’re going to send me someplace overseas, send me toVietnam,” I told him. “It’s going to be the great story of this time.”“If it were only up to me, I’d let you go,” he told me, “but myhands are tied. The feeling among most senior people here is thatwe shouldn’t be sending fathers and husbands to Vietnam.” Friendlythen laid it on pretty thick about the significance of my becomingLondon bureau chief. Not only was London our No. 1 overseasbureau, it was venerable, almost sanctified—the place where EdMurrow had founded broadcast journalism as we know it.The transfer meant giving up the house in Georgetown wherewe’d been living. For those covering official Washington, there weretwo places to live: a suburb like Chevy Chase or McLean, or the cityitself. Our small-bordering-on-tiny house just off Wisconsin Avenueon the edge of Georgetown had been a deliberate choice; we’dpicked convenience over square footage. “You’re working all the time, Dan,” Jean had reasoned. “If we get a house in the suburbs,you’re never going to be home. We need to be near the WhiteHouse, so you might be able to get home for dinner, or to put thekids to bed.”It was in its way a wonderful jewel box of a house: narrow, asmost Georgetown row houses are, full of architectural detail andhistoric, built around 1835. None of that mattered to Jean’s father,however. Jean is from Winchester, Texas, population 35—20 ofwhom are her family. Her father, Martin, was the quintessentialTexan, country born and bred, rangy, well over six feet tall, bigboots, ten-gallon hat, the works. He came to see us shortly after wemoved in, because he’d volunteered to drive our family car up fromHouston. Although not especially accident prone, as soon as heentered the house, Martin began turning black and blue. Withinhours he began banging into every architectural detail in the house,hitting his head on the door frames, barking his shins and trippingon the stairs with their worn, nonstandard tread. For him, everythingwas out of scale. It was Gulliver in Lilliput, a graphic and painfuldemonstration that folks were a lot smaller in 1835 than they aretoday.When I got up the next morning, Martin’s bags were alreadypacked. He was headed back to Texas, and nothing we could saywould change his mind. We were puzzled, but he eventuallyconfessed to Jean that he had fled because he was sure there wassomething deeply wrong with our marriage—because there wassomething deeply wrong with me. “Dan better straighten his ass outpretty quick,” he warned her. “He’s got to be into drugs or gamblingor something. You’re living in a goddamn chicken coop!”The Rathers arrived at Heathrow in the dead of London winter,January 1965, just before the death of Sir Winston Churchill. Hispassing marked the end of an era in more ways than one. Previously,bureau chiefs were expected to sink themselves deep into theculture and politics of the country where they were stationed. Parisbureau chief David Schoenbrun had been at least as French as Charles de Gaulle, but my job in London was no longer just tobecome immersed in the complexities of Parliament, BuckinghamPalace and 10 Downing Street. The first game changer was jettravel. The second was broadcast technology: Satellites andvideotape were coming into wider use. Taken together, these factorsmeant that our foreign bureaus—not just London, but all of them—were becoming springboards for covering a much bigger beat.As a result, I spent a lot of that summer away from home. Inquick succession I covered the Apostasia in July, a political crisis inGreece precipitated by the resignation of Prime Minister GeorgiosPapandreou (Greece’s “Old Man of Democracy” and the father andgrandfather of two future prime ministers), and the Indo-PakistaniWar in August and September. This was an old-fashioned shootingwar (the second) between the two countries over the disputedprovince of Kashmir and my first time witnessing full-scale combat. Ispent some time with Gurkhas; I watched Indian and Pakistaniforces clash in a pitched battle on the ground and in the air. Iwitnessed tank and artillery exchanges. (Somehow, the networkprohibition on sending family men into war zones did not seem toapply to the Indian subcontinent.) What I saw looked like somethingout of a World War II newsreel, and it made a deep impression onme, to say the least. It also made me even more eager to go toVietnam.A few months earlier, Bill Leonard, a fine correspondent who hadjust segued into management as vice president of CBS News, hadpassed through London. During his visit, I’d reminded him of mywillingness—my desire, actually—to go to Vietnam. I made what Iwould describe as an impassioned plea—arguably, some might call itbegging—and I could tell that it made an impression. U.S.involvement was starting to escalate, and both of us knew thatVietnam was on the verge of becoming a much bigger story. At thetime, he made no promises, except to say that he would carry thefervor of my request back to New York.Bill was as good as his word. When I came off of covering theIndo-Pakistani War in the early fall, he called me. “I have good newsfor you,” he said. “If you still want to go to Vietnam, you’re going to get your chance—provided you talk it over with your wife and kidsand get their okay.” CBS was sending correspondents to Vietnam onthree months’ rotation. Morley Safer, young and single, was beingrotated out. Leonard successfully argued for me to replace him.As soon as I hung up, we held a family council to discuss it, butthe outcome was never in doubt. “Go,” Jean told me simply. “Gobecause you’ve got to go.” For better or worse, she understands me.In a craft that is littered with the carcasses of marriages, she hasbeen my rock. I called Bill back within hours and said, “I’m ready togo, and I can leave this afternoon.”With a three-month stint, I’d miss the holidays, but I’d be back inEngland before winter’s end. After that, the original plan called forme to stay on in London for another year at least, and as far as Iknew, that hadn’t changed. With those expectations, Jean, Robinand Danjack remained there after I left for Saigon.I arrived in Vietnam in time for my birthday in late October. Itdidn’t take much to understand that the American top brass, both inSaigon and in Washington, were ecstatic to see him depart. ThatAugust, while I was in India, Morley had gone out with someMarines on a search-and-destroy mission. The Marines had orders totake out the village of Cam Ne, which they did.On camera.They calmly torched every thatched roof in the village, some withflamethrowers, others with Zippo lighters, about 150 houses in all.The huts were empty, but still the scene was startling and disturbing.The segment was a demonstration of the power of television.Safer’s cameraman, a Vietnamese, captured the tears and terror ofelderly men and women and the wailing of mothers with theirchildren as they were driven from their homes. People who alreadyhad so little now had nothing. It was alarming and heartbreaking tosee; it is still so today. In any conflict, Americans see ourselves asthe heroes, the good guys, but Cam Ne was not good guy behavior.In the aftermath, CBS was swamped with angry phone callscriticizing the network for showing American troops in such anegative light. None was quite so vitriolic as the call CBS networkpresident Frank Stanton received at his home the next morning. Stanton was awakened at dawn’s early light by the insistentringing. “Frank, are you trying to screw me over?” the callerbellowed when he finally answered.“Who is this?” Stanton asked sleepily.“Frank, this is your president, and yesterday your boys shat onthe American flag.” Or words to that effect.LBJ and Stanton were friends, but Johnson always did have ahair-trigger temper, not to mention a flair for colorful profanity. Thatparticular morning he was apoplectic, certain that Safer’s Cam Nesegment was proof positive that Morley was anti-American. It didn’thelp matters when he was informed that Safer was a Canadian.Johnson was happy, however, that Morley would soon be leaving.This led to the unfortunate speculation that I was going to Vietnamto replace Safer because of Cam Ne. It had nothing to do with CamNe. The truth was that Bill Leonard, Frank Stanton and all of CBSNews had a lot of faith in both Safer and me. LBJ was about to findout how much faith.My first impression of Vietnam from the air was that it was anemerald green, beautiful place, but as was always the case inVietnam, nothing was as it appeared. Almost immediately I learnedfirsthand that it was in fact a jungle hell for our servicemen andwomen. The brass in Da Nang arranged for me to board a chopperthat was headed out, and I found myself in the middle of a firefight.A Marine had been caught in the crossfire and was very badlywounded. They asked my help getting him out, and of course Iagreed. Here was this young man, much younger than I, cut down. Isaid to myself, “My God, this is somebody’s son, this is somebody’sbrother, somebody’s husband.”As soon as I settled in, I realized that there was a decision tomake. What did I want to cover? There was surely the “big picture”story—the kind you read in the history books—of sweeping troopoffensives, counteroffensives, internecine rivalry within thegovernment and diplomatic maneuvering. But there was also the“little picture”—what it was like, day in and day out, for Americantroops. I thought this was much more compelling, both in narrativeand in image. This was what I had seen that first day, and this was what Iwanted to show to the American people. Real mud. Real blood. Thescreams of the wounded and the moans of the dying. Or as ErniePyle had put it, “Here is your war.” During the Second World War,Ernie Pyle was a newspaperman who wrote about the infantrymenhe called “dogfaces”—in today’s slang the grunts—the guys in thefoxholes on the front line. My priority as I saw it was tocommunicate to the nation the reality of what the war was like fromtheir perspective. (I brushed aside the unfortunate fact that Pyle hadbeen killed on Ie Shima, an island off Okinawa, while doing exactlythat.) I wanted to walk the ground, to see, feel and smell whatcombat was all about and to be an honest broker of thatinformation. What I wanted to do in Vietnam was what Ernie Pylehad done in World War II.By the time I arrived, there were many more grunts in Vietnamthan there had been even a few short months earlier. In March1965, a contingent of 3,500 Marines had been ordered to Vietnam todefend the perimeter of U.S. air bases. At Lyndon Johnson’sdirective, they were followed by wave after wave of rapid andmassive new deployments—a “surge,” if you will—as we transitionedout of our fig-leaf role as “advisers” to the Army of the Republic ofVietnam (South Vietnam) and into direct military engagement withthe North Vietnamese and Vietcong. By the end of 1965, the conflicthad escalated dramatically, and we had committed almost 200,000American troops to the war. (At the time of the Tet Offensive—January 1968—there would be upward of half a million U.S. soldiersin Vietnam.)Morley Safer stayed in Saigon long enough to pass me the baton—to run down his sources with me and give me their vital contactinformation. High on his list was a fellow named Pham Xuan An. Anwas actually every correspondent’s go-to guy. Some of the biggestnames covering Vietnam, including David Halberstam, Peter Arnett,Stanley Karnow and Neil Sheehan, depended on him and used himextensively. Vietnamese by birth and educated in the United States,An was a fully bilingual journalist. He had attended Orange CoastCollege in California and then interned at theSacramento Bee. From 1965 on, An was a staff correspondent forTIME magazine.Beyond that, he was witty and extremely personable. He had areputation as Saigon’s best dog trainer, specializing in Germanshepherds. He collected rare birds and bought and sold them at theBird Market. He was nicknamed “General Givral” after the Saigoncafé where he could often be found, chain-smoking and shooting thebreeze. (Givral itself, recently demolished, was during the warsomething of a center of intrigue, not unlike Rick’s in the movieCasablanca.)By reputation, An was the best-connected source in Saigon. Hecould explain the Vietnamese to the Americans, and the Americansto the Vietnamese. As the new kid in town, I got a briefing from himwhen I arrived. To double-check, I vetted him with the wire services.They confirmed An’s trustworthiness and recommended strongly thatI rely on him, just as my predecessor had. Pham Xuan An had greatinformation—by God, he had great information. He had sterlingcontacts at the highest levels within both the South Vietnamesegovernment and the South Vietnamese military. He regularlyattended highly sensitive off-the-record briefings with U.S. militaryleaders. I knew that I could bust my ass for days and not get asmuch as I could from one conversation with General Givral.In the end, however, I never really used him. Part of myreluctance was orneriness, but part of it was seat-of-the-pantsinstinct. I just didn’t take to this guy. To me, there was always aniggling, intangible something about him that didn’t sit quite right.Mostly, however, it was my Ernie Pyle vision of how I wanted tocover the war that led me to avoid him. The bottom line was that Ijust wanted to get out into the field and experience things formyself. An’s high-level connections weren’t much use to me if myfirst priority was to head for the front lines to talk with our own GIsabout what it was like on patrol.Again, nothing in Vietnam was as it first appeared. Turned outthat Pham Xuan An was a spy for North Vietnam. He had been apart of the movement since he was 16 years old—even before hewent to college in California. While flawlessly maintaining his coveras aTIME magazine journalist, An was gathering valuable intel and passing it on to the Communists. In January 1976, less than a yearafter the last helicopter left Saigon, Pham Xuan An was made a Heroof the People’s Army. The citation is the equivalent of our Medal ofHonor and one of the highest accolades Hanoi could bestow. EveryAmerican correspondent who had befriended him was astonished.An’s activities both during and after the war were chronicled byLarry Berman in a book entitledPerfect Spy: The Incredible DoubleLife of Pham Xuan An. His exploits make any character in a John leCarré novel look like Ned in knee pants. Walking his Germanshepherd through Saigon neighborhoods, his obedient dog lifted hisleg to pee on specific trees, marking them as dead letter drops. Lateat night, An photographed documents at home, while his wife stoodguard. With the help of his longtime courier, an illiterate betel-nut-chewing woman named Nguyen Thi Ba, An’s film was smuggled outof Saigon in meat rolls wrapped in banana leaves, or in bars of soap.He wrote messages about what he’d learned in U.S. briefings usingrice water “ink” on ordinary wrapping paper—ink that disappeared assoon as it dried. An then used the wrapping paper to cover springrolls—spring rolls that he gave to Ba at their rendezvous in the BirdMarket.Pham Xuan An died in 2006, disillusioned with what his countryhad become. He was saddened that Vietnam apparently had simplyreplaced an American presence with an even harsher Russianpresence. At his burial, his final request was not to be buried tooclose to Communists.CBS headquarters in Saigon was located in the Caravelle Hotel. Myquarters were in the hotel as well. ABC also had its bureau there, asdid theNew York Times. In addition, it was home to the embassiesof Australia and New Zealand. Built in 1959, by Vietnam standards itwas state of the art. It was one of the few really well air-conditionedplaces in Saigon; it also had its own generator. Still, the faint smell ofnuoc mam—fish sauce—wafted through the corridors.The Caravelle’s rooftop bar was the de facto press club; I spentless time up there than some correspondents did. I had no interest in hanging around Saigon, attending daily military briefings (abanquet of misinformation that came to be known as the FiveO’Clock Follies), and going to tea and dinner with the wives ofdiplomats. I got out into the field as much as I could, and like everyother correspondent who left town, I became a hitchhiker. The onlyway to get anywhere was to beg rides with combat troops andmedevac pilots. We learned pretty quickly that the medevac heloswere a great way to get to where the action was. The very fact thatthey’d been called in told us that there was fighting. Sadly butconveniently, we also knew for certain that not only were they goingin, they were coming back out.I traveled with my cameraman, Jerry Adams; I’d known him sincemy days in Houston at KHOU. Jerry had seen action in World War II,and I was grateful to be working with someone who had combatexperience. As we had in Dallas, we stuck story materials—film,audio, script—into one of those bright yellow grapefruit bags. Thenext challenge was to get the bag back to Saigon, even if we werestaying on in the field. The footage didn’t always make it. Some ofour best work might still be in the remnants of grapefruit bags in theunderbrush somewhere, tossed out with the ammo and spare partsto a unit that was under fire.One of the first things I did when I got to Saigon was to getoutfitted with fatigues. When covering the civil rights movement, Ihad dressed in a suit, because it was important to look like areporter, a professional. In Vietnam, being professional meantdressing in field gear and being able to fend for yourself.Getting off the helicopter, you often didn’t have a lot of time tomake a good impression. It was important to be able to immediatelyreassure the commanding officer that you weren’t going to needcoddling or impede the mission. Over the months in Vietnam, threesimple but essential rules of the “Rather Guide to Covering Combat”evolved. With revisions and amendments for changing localconditions, they still apply today.• RULE 1:Dress the part. Wear a dark safari jacket or fatigues and proper footwear forthe terrain. When I first got to Vietnam, I was kidded andcalled “Mr. GI,” but from the beginning my attitude was to getinto the field, stay in the field as long as I could and get asclose as possible to combat. That’s the way I operated. Therewere some correspondents who looked like backpackers out ofcollege. I didn’t have a problem with people who dresseddown or took fewer things; I had a problem with people whowere not prepared.When a platoon leader is looking you over, his eyes alwaysgo straight to your feet. On one occasion, Jerry and I met upwith a Special Forces unit that was to attack a communicationstarget and create a diversion in advance of a larger action.Another highly respected correspondent was going along aswell, and he had already arrived. I could see the commanderlooking at this guy’s shoes with absolute disdain. He waswearing Gucci-style loafers—the ones with the little metalhorse bit across the top. Any credibility he might have had wasdraining right out of him, but he was clueless. There is nofaster way to lose credibility with a combat unit than to appearin loafers.• RULE 2:Make sure you are self-sufficient.Don’t be a burden.• RULE 2A:Make sure that you are obviously self-sufficient.Officers and noncoms sizing you up for the first time need toknow right away that you won’t be needing anything fromthem except access and information. Two canteens tells themthat you won’t be asking for water. Maybe you open your packso they can see that you have your own food. Usually I bringpeanut butter and protein bars. In Vietnam I also took what Ineeded to take care of myself for the night, including a poncho, a hammock, medical supplies and personal items. Icarried these in a butt pack attached to a web belt around mywaist. The butt pack attached to the web belt at the rear,nestled in the lumbar region between waist and rump.Canteens hung from the web belt as well, one on either side.The web belt and attachments were supported by websuspenders over the shoulders. Sometimes I carried a fullbackpack instead of or in addition to the butt pack. In abackpack I could carry extra clothing, a tent and a lot more,but with just the butt pack, I was far more mobile and able torun farther, faster. All too often, that was important.Be ready to carry your own medical supplies, includinghemostatic bandages. Especially hemostatic bandages. Theseare also called “blood stop” bandages—if you get a bullet holeand you slap it on, it forms a seal and stops the hemorrhaging.It’s not that the grunts wouldn’t share with you—they would—it’s just that they’re thinking, “If this guy gets hit, then I haveto give up my bandage.” When you carry your own, it alsomarks you as someone who knows what war is.I did not carry a weapon in Vietnam, although there weresome correspondents who did. I’m not a combatant; ifcaptured, I didn’t want anybody to think I was a soldier. Onthe other hand, I didn’t want to give the impression that I wascompletely useless, either. When I was trying to hitchhike witha unit, the CO would almost always ask if I was armed. “Nosir,” I’d say, “but I know how to use one. I can disassembleand reassemble both an M16 and a Kalashnikov.” If he neededconvincing, I’d ask to have a look at an infantryman’s rifle,break it down, and put it back together.• RULE 3:Find the captains and sergeants.They are the keys to any effective fighting force. It’s fine totalk to corporals and generals, but when you want to knowwhat is really going on, straight/no chaser, your best bet is totalk to the captain of the forwardmost combat unit and his most experienced sergeant. The captains tend to be young,but not too young, and the sergeants tend to be old, but nottoo old. I was 33, old enough and young enough to talk withall of them.In all my time in Vietnam, I never had a captain or asergeant lie to me, or dress it up, or give me the official line,or tell me what he thought I wanted to hear. I’d crawl into ahole, mortar rounds going over, to talk with them. “DanRather, CBS News. Can you bring me up to date on thesituation?”These men were honest and straightforward, sometimesbrutally honest and straightforward. “We’re getting our asseskicked. We’re taking very heavy casualties, and if the weatherdoesn’t clear up soon so we can get the helicopters in so wecan get the hell out of here, we’re all going to be dead.” Thenhe’d look me in the eyes to add, “And that includes you, too,Mr. Rather.”We were overrun a couple of times. One night it was raining likehell. I had taken my hammock and tied it between two trees, thenstrung another piece of rope above it and slung my poncho over thatto create a makeshift tent. (See Rule 2.) And by the way, you knottwo used socks—the more used, the better—on the hammock, oneat either end, because if there’s a snake, he’s not going to crawl pastthose socks. There was a Japanese fellow, another journalist,sleeping on the ground below me. He didn’t have a poncho, so I hadoffered him a chance to sleep beneath me to have at least someprotection from the rain. He was wet, but not nearly as wet as hewould have been otherwise.Meanwhile, the rotten weather had enabled the Moving Hats, asthe VC were called, to infiltrate our position. Suddenly, there was alot of confusion, and a lot of shooting in the dark. The Japanesecorrespondent froze like a rabbit. He was scared shitless, which wasan entirely reasonable reaction—I was more than a tad concernedmyself. I didn’t know whether to pick up a weapon or not. This wasone of those occasions when I instantly had that ever-so-basicdebate with myself: If it really gets down to it, life or death, shoot/don’t shoot, would I grab a rifle and pull the trigger? The truthis that I went back and forth about this crucial decision. I didn’tknow then and, thank heavens, I doubt that I will ever know.Fortunately it was all over pretty quickly, but incidents like thiswere to be expected if you were going where the story was—whereour troops were. The footage we took when we went out on patrol,the footage that people eventually saw on TV, was genuine. We triedour best to tell it as it was. We went out where the war was beingfought and captured what was happening, first on film, much lateron videotape. At first, we were sending our film footage out to beprocessed in New York. Between the difficulty of getting materials toSaigon, finding a commercial airline that was flying on a regularbasis and working on a script with no telephone service, that couldtake as long as a week. The big difference came when televisionbegan to use videotape, commercial airlines were faster and flightsmore frequent and satellites became more reliable and lessexpensive. All satellite feeds in those days were sent out from Tokyoor Bangkok. Such feeds were not possible from Vietnam. Livecoverage of the war was thus impossible. With luck, sometimes wecould bring our story delay time down to two or two and a half days—but this happened only rarely. Luck, like everything else inVietnam, was in short supply.I realized that portions of my children’s childhood were flying byin my absence, but keeping in touch was a challenge. You couldn’tjust pick up a phone in Vietnam and place an international call.There was, however, a telephone call center in Saigon. When I calledJean and the children, I minimized any discussion of the danger. Isuspected, however, that I wasn’t fooling Jean in the slightest—shewas perfectly capable of figuring this out on her own. One aspectthat did help was that Jean and the kids were still in London. TheBBC ran pieces from CBS only rarely, so in general they were sparedseeing me reporting from the field with rounds coming in overhead.In my time there, I saw a good deal of Vietnamese countryside,from deep down in the Mekong Delta up to the DMZ on the borderwith North Vietnam, from the coastline at places like Da Nang andwestward over the Ho Chi Minh Trail into Laos. I saw a lot of the war, and the more of the war I saw, the more I realized that what wasbeing said in Washington about the situation did not match what Icould clearly see was the reality on the ground. And for our troops,that reality was a minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour, day-by-day deathstruggle.You couldn’t be with our soldiers in that incredibly lethalenvironment, thousands of miles from home, see and share thereality of what they were going through, and then hear people inWashington describe a war that did not exist. The Johnsonadministration deliberately exercised what was called “minimumcandor” in providing facts to the press. This clumsy attempt atmanaged news was a failure. Worse yet, it severely damaged publictrust in any information coming from the government about the war,creating what came to be called the “credibility gap.”In any war, particularly a protracted war, there has to be a strongdegree of communicable trust between the leader and the led. Inthe beginning, Americans had that trust in Johnson and in hisconduct of the war, but as it dragged on, that public trust waseroded. President Johnson and the rest of the leadership inWashington, both civilians and the Pentagon, wanted to paint apicture of the war as told by Hans Christian Andersen. Everythingwas always going well, and those aspects that weren’t going wellwere always improving.Bullfeathers.I knew better, because the captains and the sergeants knewbetter. And it was their truth that we put on the air. That’s why I andmost other reputable journalists boycotted the military’s Five O’ClockFollies. Every night on theCBS Evening News, our footage of GIs onthe front lines trumped the Pentagon’s whole-cloth statistics.The war changed the way Americans thought about television,and television was a major factor in changing the way Americathought about the war. CBS led the coverage of Vietnam. In thesame way that Ernie Leiser and others realized that civil rights was abig, important story and wanted to swarm it and franchise it, we didthe same with Vietnam. We brought the war into the living rooms of America. In and ofitself, however, that was not sufficient to change American opinionabout the war. What happened, I believe, is that increased televisioncoverage paralleled the surge in troop deployment, and rapidescalation of the war produced a marked and sudden increase incasualties. Soon enough, most folks around the country had heardabout someone from their hometown who’d been killed or wounded,even if they didn’t know him personally—the boy down the streetwho had been the star quarterback for the football team, or the ladwho had delivered the morning paper. When these local young menstarted coming back without their limbs, without their eyes, withouttheir sanity or in flag-draped coffins, that’s when most people beganto seriously question the war.And this is where our Ernie Pyle “little picture” coverage of thesoldiers in Vietnam and the “big picture” coverage of the geopoliticalissues about the war converged. As had been the case with civilrights, and would later be the case with Iraq and Afghanistan, whatfolks saw on television was increasingly at variance with what theywere being told. That dichotomy would eventually call the wholeU.S. commitment into question.LBJ understood this all too well. His anger at our coverage of CamNe was just the beginning. Throughout the war, Johnson tried tocompel the kind of positive, upbeat war coverage he believedpatriotic Americans were duty-bound to provide. In short, he tried todeal with the media the way he had always dealt with his colleaguesin the Senate, by cajoling, and if necessary bullying, to get his way.It didn’t work.I don’t think I ever heard President Johnson personally blame themedia for making the war unpopular, but many in the upperechelons of government and the military surely felt and stated thattelevision incited antiwar demonstrations. To them, the press wasthe real enemy, at least as much as Ho Chi Minh or the Vietcong. Atthe time, Republicans generally supported the war. But so did manyDemocrats and supporters of LBJ. Many from both parties began tosay, “The war is really going well. It’s just those press people (like Dan Rather, like CBS, and many others) who are accentuating thenegative and turning the country against the war.”This made things increasingly uncomfortable at Black Rock, CBS’sbrand-new corporate headquarters. Lyndon Johnson and CBSpresident Frank Stanton had been friends for about 30 years, butVietnam seriously tested their relationship. Stanton had long been atease in Washington, working (with Johnson’s clout firmly behindhim) to benefit broadcasting in general and CBS in particular.Johnson railed that what CBS was doing was a disservice to thecountry. Stanton pushed back, arguing that the role of the press inwartime cannot be reduced to that of a cheerleader. As the warescalated, it became harder for Stanton to reconcile his personalrelationship with LBJ with his responsibility to protect the integrity ofCBS News. Eventually, it would become all but impossible.The heightened tension and distrust between the press and thegovernment is still with us today, but it can be traced back to ourcoverage in Vietnam. As a journalist, I didn’t go to Vietnam with anyantiwar sentiment. When I arrived, I had no opinions about the war,other than that it was a big, important, developing story. I didn’t goin with any agenda. I had no agenda while I was there. I had noagenda when I came out, except to put on the American televisionscreen the war as it was, as opposed to how some were trying toconvince people it was.Was this aiding and abetting the enemy? Did that make usjournalists unpatriotic? Hardly. The members of the press I haveknown have been every bit as patriotic as any American, especiallyin time of war. And if my country is at war, I want my country to win,whatever the definition of win is. That, however, was one of theenduring problems of Vietnam. There never was a satisfactorydefinition of winning.It is not my purpose to paint the press in some kind of heroiclight, but instead to point out that the press is an essential part ofhow government of, by, and for the people is supposed to work. Thepeople have a right to know what is being done in their name, andwhen the press finds out that something’s not right, we have anobligation to call attention to it. If this was something Lyndon Johnson tried to forget, it was aprinciple about which the Supreme Court saw fit to remind hissuccessor, Richard Nixon. “The press was protected so that it couldbare the secrets of government and inform the people,” wroteJustice Hugo Black at the time of the Pentagon Papers. “Only a freeand unrestrained press can effectively expose deception ingovernment. And paramount among the responsibilities of a freepress is the duty to prevent any part of the government fromdeceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die offoreign fevers and foreign shot and shell.”I left Vietnam in 1966. I was not back in London by Valentine’sDay, or even by the Fourth of July. My three-month stint stretchedinto the better part of a year, but Vietnam stayed with me for muchlonger than that. For about three or four years after I left, I hadnightmares. I had seen a lot of terrible things, and it was as if theywouldn’t let go of me. A jukebox came on in my head and replayedthe horror over and over, and there was nothing I could do about it.I can only imagine what it was like for those who fought there, whatit may still be like for some who fought there.Not long ago, there was a reunion of reporters in Saigon—now HoChi Minh City—who had covered Vietnam. I was invited, but Icouldn’t bring myself to go. I had an opportunity to visit severalparts of Asia on a cruise ship in March 2011. And, honestly, I wouldnot have gone if Jean had not wanted to go. Jean made it a bettertrip for me, and I narrated some of my experiences during the warfor her. I was nevertheless uncomfortable; it was anything but asentimental journey. One of the strong feelings that I had was thatthe country of Vietnam has made a lot of economic progress. Butthen again, I think of how much economic progress they might havemade if they had real political freedom.I am still conflicted in my own mind about Vietnam, about whathappened there and how it happened. I amnot conflicted about themen and women who served there. I have the utmost respect andadmiration for them. I’ve always felt very strongly about the peoplewho fought the war. The entire country is soaked with Americanblood. It may have been the wrong war, for the wrong reasons, in the wrong place, but those who fought that war did so because weasked them to go and because they love their country. I used tohave a habit of visiting the Vietnam Memorial on each trip to DC; Istill do from time to time. I know a lot of people whose names areetched on those black tablets; their faces are etched in my memory.I stop to remember and communicate.The quagmire of Vietnam and the inability of the national leadershipand the military to define success gave rise to the Powell Doctrine,first enunciated by Colin Powell shortly before the Gulf War (1990–1991). At the time, Powell was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.For the United States to put troops in harm’s way, he said, we shouldhave a clear mission, a clear exit strategy, popular support, and aclear definition of what constitutes victory. Powell had served inVietnam as a junior officer, and he had a clear grasp of the problemsthe military had faced there.How quickly we forgot.By the time Powell became secretary of state, we were watchinga Vietnam-style dynamic play out in Iraq. In 2003, after the theatricsof “shock and awe,” we stormed into the country knowing virtuallynothing about it, its history or traditions. We “took” Baghdadexpecting to be greeted as liberators—Paris, 1944. After Baghdadfell, however, things quickly bogged down, not that Washingtonwould admit it.And as was the case in Vietnam, nothing was quite as it firstappeared. I made many trips to Iraq, and whenever I got outbeyond the Green Zone and spoke with the captains and thesergeants, often off the record, a very different and far morepessimistic picture emerged—a picture that was completely at oddswith “Mission Accomplished” and the rest of the message that wascoming from the Pentagon and the White House.I wish I could say that Afghanistan is better. Perhaps we mighthave learned in Vietnam how difficult if not impossible it is to remakea society. Now that we are in our second decade in Afghanistan,however, the familiar echoes of Vietnam are sounding louder and more haunting. We are fighting massive government corruption,trying to revamp the Afghan legal system, trying to teach literacy,trying to improve the status of women, trying to oversee freeelections. We are once again hearing about the need to win thehearts and minds of the people. Afghanistan and Vietnam aredifferent. The only thing that is the same is the mistakes we made inboth situations.How quickly we forget. CHAPTER 8AfghanistanI must have been quite a sight that March afternoon in 1980 in theopen-air bazaar in Peshawar, Pakistan. Under the supervision ofMirwais, our 20-year-old guide, I was decked out in native garb—secondhand, of course. Everything was earth tones—grey and brownand olive drab. It was impossible to tell whether this had been thecolor when the clothes were new, or whether it was an acquiredveneer of dust and dirt. Furthermore, it was a question I preferrednot to ask. I also did not want to know what had happened to theprevious owner. But there I was, clad in baggy drawstring pantsmade of rough cotton and a loose-fitting long tunic. My pajama-likeoutfit was topped off by a combination shawl and blanket—the localequivalent of a serape—and an instant reminder of why those littlecoverlets crocheted by your maiden aunt were called “afghans.” Ifonly the impeccably tailored Charles Collingwood could have seenme then.This was the birth of “Gunga Dan,” and I’ve endured a fair shareof ribbing about it ever since. The clothes were, however, absolutelynecessary for the journey. With Mirwais and four others, I wasgetting ready to leave our hotel in the dead of night to sneak intoAfghanistan—on foot.I’d already more or less snuck out of New York. After persuadingDon Hewitt, producer of60 Minutes, to let me make the trip—nosmall accomplishment—Don and I had sort of forgotten to askpermission from the higher-ups in News Div, because we didn’t want to risk getting no for an answer. Only my family and a few stafferswithin60 Minutes were told the itinerary. I knew it would bedangerous; Jean, who by now was all too accustomed to sending meoff on these kinds of journeys, was very aware that this was morehazardous than most. She wept as I left. So did my daughter, Robin.I had some of the best veteran CBS staff with me: producer AndyLack (now CEO of Bloomberg Media Group), cameraman MikeEdwards and soundman Peter O’Connor, as well as the excellentcultural historian/translator Eden Naby. Mirwais Yasini, our guide,had been “volunteered” to lead us into the country by his triballeader. In terms of trusting him or not, Andy and I had nothing butthe seat of our drawstring pants to go on.Peshawar is located near the eastern end of the Khyber Pass.Leaving the ancient city, we hiked northwest through the pass likesalmon headed upstream, walking against an oncoming tide ofrefugees headed out of Afghanistan, fleeing the war. Some carriedmeager belongings; many had nothing at all. In late December1979, the Soviets had sent 100,000 troops into Afghanistan. Inblitzkrieg fashion they had quickly occupied the major cities andinstalled a new head of government, after having the sittingpresident executed. Two months later, the Russians were in controlof much of the country.By then, there was almost no official U.S. presence inAfghanistan. Our last ambassador, Adolph Dubs, had beenkidnapped in February 1979 and subsequently was killed during abotched rescue raid on the hotel in Kabul where he was being held.After his death, and particularly in the wake of the Soviet invasion,the U.S. embassy was operating with a skeleton staff. Make nomistake: We weren’t supposed to be there at all. We were a CBSNews crew walking into Afghanistan with no official authorization toenter the country. We carried no passports or diplomatic papers thatwould help us. If any of our group were to be apprehended, it wouldnot go well.We wanted to show Americans the face of the war in Afghanistan,a war that most people had little or no knowledge about. There hadnot been much initial opposition to the Russians during the dead of winter, but as the weather warmed, local fighters, calledmujahideen, had increased their activity, striking back against theSoviet invaders in classic guerrilla fashion. Not far from the Afghan-Pakistan border, we hooked up with an Afghan resistance leader alsonamed Yasini (I believe he was an uncle of Mirwais). We traveledwith him and his squad of fighters all around the Kunar Valley. Heeventually took us to within a couple of football fields of the end ofthe runway at Jalalabad Airport, where Soviet helicopters, fightersand other aircraft were clearly visible. Cameraman Mike Edwards andI accompanied Yasini’s fighters high into the mountains. Once there,what began as a recon mission turned into a firefight, followed by abreathless escape from Russian troops across rice paddies andpoppy fields.At a primitive makeshift field hospital, we filmed casualties andrecorded conversations with doctors and patients. Both victims andmedical personnel confirmed that the Soviets were using napalm andsome sort of toxic gas on the noncombatant civilian population,forcing people out of their homes in order to starve out themujahideen. They also used bombing and infantry attacks to levelvillages and destroy crops and livestock. The secondary goal was togenerate as many refugees as possible. Judging by the flood ofpeople we’d seen streaming into Pakistan, this brutal strategy washaving the desired effect.To keep from being discovered, we often moved by night. Wetook refuge in farmhouses and lean-tos, and in one case in ascorpion-infested stable behind a mosque. To keep our health, weadhered as closely as possible to Rather’s Rules for Survival:Don’t drink the water (without boiling or purifying).Don’t eat the meat.Don’t even think about looking at the women. Don’t even lookin their general direction.Our diet was unusual, to say the least. We subsisted on naan, thelocal bread (insides only—there’s no telling what might have made contact with the crust), tinned Vienna sausages, peanut butter, andnips from a flask of Wild Turkey. We were inside Afghanistan foralmost two weeks. By that time, despite the water purificationtablets, two in the group had come down with dysentery, butMirwais got us out and safely back to Peshawar. He proved to be areliable and brave young man. He now, these long years later,continues to play an important role in the revitalization ofAfghanistan as a member of the Afghan parliament.Andy and I didn’t have time to shower or change before racingfor the airport for the first leg of our journey home. We barely madeit onto the plane, lugging our precious yellow grapefruit bags of film.And, despite airborne efforts at hygiene in the aircraft lavatory, wewere still a sight—and stench—to behold on the Concorde that tookus on the last leg back to New York. After our reports aired, theRussians were mightily displeased by our revelation that they weregassing civilians, so much so that their radio broadcasts intoAfghanistan offered a bounty for my death or capture.Made my day.Our reports caught the attention of Texas congressman CharlieWilson. Like me, Charlie was a graduate of Sam Houston TeachersCollege, but we were not there at the same time. I knew him, butnot well. He was Texan to the core. While in Las Vegas he saw thepiece about Afghanistan and called me. I told him about the refugeecamps, which were probably the worst human conditions I had everseen. I had no idea that he was going to throw himself into thissubject as completely as he did.I have been back to Afghanistan about a dozen times since, neverin quite such dramatic fashion, but each time I have been awed bythe size and scope of the country, and by the seeming intractabilityof its problems. Most of all, I am humbled by how much I do notknow. How much weall do not know.Larger than France, Afghanistan is a landlocked country thatshares long borders with the Asiatic republics of the former SovietUnion on the north (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan),Pakistan on the east and south and Iran on its western flank. It even abuts China for roughly 50 miles high in the Pamir Mountains, alongthe ancient trade route known as the Silk Road.We think of it as a nation, but it is not, at least not by ourwestern understanding of the term. In truth, Afghanistan is acollection of provinces inhabited by tribes. Although no ethnic grouphas a majority, Pashtuns and Tajiks make up roughly 40 and 30percent of the population respectively. Hazaras and Uzbeksconstitute another 10 percent each. That said, many of the tribeshave subsets, and even some of the tribal subsets have subsets.Although civilization here is very old, civility is not. Fiercely heldtribal and ethnic loyalties have given rise to grudges, hostilities andhatreds held for centuries, if not for millennia. These are coupledwith a split-second readiness to settle quarrels through violent andoften lethal confrontations. Afghanistan is an entire country ofMontagues and Capulets, Hatfields and McCoys, Corleones andBarzinis.These warring tribal factions, together with its dauntinggeography, have kept Afghanistan divided into quasi-independentdistricts and territories, and thus kept it from being the aggressoragainst its neighbors. This has also, in turn, kept Afghanistan frombeing conquered.Many, from Alexander the Great in 330 BC, to Genghis Khan, tothe 19th-century British, to the Soviets, have tried. All havecontrolled some of the country for a period of time, but never all ofit, and never for long. And in every case, the effort has been costlyin terms of blood and treasure. Afghanistan’s nickname—“Graveyardof Empires”—is richly deserved.In October 2001, President George Bush ordered U.S. forces intoAfghanistan in hot pursuit of Osama bin Laden. Their objectiveswere:1) To catch the mastermind of 9/112) To dismantle his organization, al-Qaeda3) To overthrow the repressive Taliban regime that harbored him Because of their many human rights abuses, the Taliban werewidely despised among the Afghan populace, and the third objectivewas easily accomplished within weeks. Bringing bin Laden to justice,however, would take another president, almost another decade, andthe extraordinary combined efforts of the National Security Agency,the CIA, and Seal Team 6. In December 2001, our Special Forces didhave bin Laden trapped in a cave in the mountains of Tora Bora, butword came from Army CENTCOM in Florida to hold off. The thinkingat the time was that it would look better if Muslim forces capturedhim. The top brass ordered our Special Forces to stand down andwait for the tribal leaders to come get him. In the interim, of course,bin Laden slipped away.The logical next step for our forces should have been to continuepursuing bin Laden and to finish eliminating the power and influenceof the Taliban. One of the teachings of the U.S. military, all throughits ranks, is “Exploit success.” Whether at the squad or theatercommand level, leaders are taught that when you are succeeding,that’s the time to follow up and pour it on.Inexplicably, instead of pressing our advantage after toppling theTaliban, President Bush did a version of moonwalking in the endzone and turned his attention to Saddam Hussein and Iraq. Usingthe pretext that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, the Bushadministration launched Operation Iraqi Freedom on March 20,2003. To support that mission, they starved the Afghan war forresources, men and materials.It was a strategic blunder of historic proportions.Looking back today on our original objectives in Afghanistan,taking out bin Laden satisfied objective No. 1. With his death, al-Qaeda’s influence in the Middle East is clearly waning, putting uswell on the way to meeting objective No. 2.But that may be as far as we will ever get. When the Bushadministration refocused on Iraq, it allowed the Taliban to regroup,which now makes accomplishing objective No. 3 on a sustained basismore difficult than we ever could have imagined. After losing controlin Kabul and the other major cities, the Taliban, which we had all but vanquished in 2001, established a new and more deeply entrenchedfoothold in the rural provinces.The question for the Obama administration became what to doabout it. In quest of objective No. 3, what started out as a concise,clearly defined mission has morphed into something far morenebulous. In Vietnam we made the mistake of not understanding thepeople and the culture. We did the same thing in Iraq. InAfghanistan, we compounded that error many times over. We havenow taken it upon ourselves to remake Afghan society in the face ofstaggering odds. In a fragmented country with no history ofdemocratic institutions, we are trying to establish a legitimatelyelected central government, create a national army and police force,bring equal (or at least better) status to women and teach childrenand adults of both sexes to read. We are also trying to wean farmersoff Afghanistan’s leading cash crop, opium. This is what thePentagon terms “mission creep,” but in this case it’s on a grandscale.Today, our continued presence in the country flies in the face ofthe lessons we thought we learned in Vietnam, as summarized bythe Powell Doctrine. More than a decade after we first went intoAfghanistan, it is now far more difficult to understand why we arestill spending billions of dollars and thousands of lives in this war. Itwas easier to justify when Americans were asking why a $25 millionprice on bin Laden’s head didn’t bring more leads, and whythousands of U.S. troops combing the mountains of Afghanistancouldn’t find him. The answer to the first question is that it wouldhave been a death sentence for anyone to have given up Osama binLaden. And you only need to see the rugged mountains and thehoneycomb of caves and tunnels to understand why bin Laden couldeasily escape, no matter how many American troops were searchingfor him.The fact that Osama bin Laden was able to live comfortably foryears in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in the shadow of the Pakistaniequivalent of West Point, is another matter entirely. In Afghanistan,as in Vietnam, nothing is as it first appears, and the fate ofAfghanistan is inextricably linked with that of Pakistan. The Pakistanis are masters of double and triple and quadruplegames. What the so-called official Pakistani position is depends onwhom you ask, and when. There also exist serious rifts and rivalriesamong various civil and military factions in the government. Thesefactions frequently work at cross-purposes and easily change theirallegiances if they think it is to their advantage.Before 9/11, head of the Pakistani army Pervez Musharraf hadsent Pakistani soldiers into Afghanistan to fight side by side with theTaliban. Musharraf became president of Pakistan just months beforethe attack on the World Trade Center, after which he allied himselfwith the United States against the Taliban.At least, so it appeared. At the same time, he tacitly gavepermission for Taliban forces to freely cross the border and usePakistan as a sanctuary, so long as they did not attack Pakistanitroops. Papers released by WikiLeaks confirmed these and manyother suspicions about the Pakistanis, beginning with their sharing ofintelligence information with the Taliban and their protection ofOsama bin Laden for years after 9/11. We were only able to find andkill bin Laden by taking Pakistani intelligence out of the loop. Giventhe immensity of what we are trying to accomplish, it should notsurprise anyone that we are not “winning” in Afghanistan. It shouldalso not surprise anyone that popular support is eroding at home.The echoes of Vietnam are growing louder and louder as the militaryand the administration keep trying to give us the good news—andonly the good news—about a situation that common sense suggestsis either stagnating, or deteriorating, or impossible to sustain in thelong run.The Pentagon’s core technique in this regard is what they call“strategic communications,” which is less a tool designed to conveyinformation than one intended to bend public opinion. The linchpinof this strategy is stringent control of the conditions for mediaaccess. The Pentagon considers this a lesson learned from Vietnam,but it strikes me that they took away the wrong conclusion from thatwar.Important high-ranking officers remain convinced that militaryvictory in Vietnam had been within their grasp but that the press turned against them, and then turned the country against them. Inshort, they believe that the press is to blame for the U.S. defeat.This is revisionist history at its most absurd. As I heard repeatedlyfrom captains and sergeants from the Mekong Delta to the DMZ,victory in Vietnam was nowhere in sight.Nevertheless, “strategic communications” means that control ofthe flow of information is now considered an integral part of any wareffort. In order to “dominate the information environment,” thePentagon has clamped down on press coverage. In Vietnam,accredited reporters were allowed to go everywhere we wanted togo. We could ask any helicopter pilot for a lift; many correspondents,including me, hitchhiked all over the country. That is no longerpermitted. Beginning with the Gulf War, the military started tocontrol not just who could go, but when and where and how long. InAfghanistan, unless you have your own independent transportation,all press trips must be carefully planned out and vetted by themilitary. Generally speaking, you just make a request to thePentagon. If, however, you have a relationship with someone inAfghanistan, you might be moved along more quickly by thePentagon, and even be granted more access.The Gulf War was also the beginning of the embed strategy,which permitted journalists to attach to certain units. On the face ofit, embedding perhaps does not sound so bad. Reporters go wherethey might not otherwise have access, and they get a chance to talkto real troops, one-on-one. And as in Vietnam, soldiers patrolling thewire will always answer a straight question with a straight answer.Reporters also get to see the war “up close and personal,” as thesaying goes, perhaps more up close and more personal than theywould like. Indeed, at first glance it does not sound that muchdifferent from my first visit to Afghanistan, when I was “embedded”with Yasini’s mujahideen.The negatives of the officially sanctioned embed program,however, are significant and violate many of the core principles ofindependent journalism. Embeds come and go with their units; theygenerally are not allowed to stay behind or move to another locationon their own. This means that once they are embedded, they lose control over their own itinerary. The military is also free to determinewhich units take on embedded journalists and which do not. Therehave been suggestions that those trying to “dominate theinformation environment” might be inclined to permit more embedsin parts of Afghanistan where things are going well and fewer inprovinces where they are going poorly.The Pentagon anticipated that the embeds would bond with thesoldiers they traveled with, in effect becoming adjunct members ofthe military’s propaganda team. That is often what happened, andsome members of the press became advocates for the orthodoxmilitary point of view. Sy Hersh has called it “the worst single thingthat has happened to journalism in the last decade and a half.”Hersh and a few others have protested, but on the whole therehas not been nearly enough vehement objection from journalistsabout any of this. One of the aspects of our involvement inAfghanistan that is not talked about is the failure of the Americanpress—orany press—to really cover the war. Sadly, Afghanistan nolonger gets much play on the front page or on the evening news.Part of the problem, of course, is the new budget-conscious attitudetoward covering the news. Wars are expensive, not just for ourarmed forces, but for the media as well. There is no well-staffedKabul bureau for any of the major networks; some have no bureauat all. Most news sources now rely on stringers and occasional visitsby correspondents, if that. Even those, however, are less frequentthan they were in prior conflicts. This dearth of coverage isunconscionable, given that we have young Americans in perilfighting wars we signed off on.It often strikes me in a war zone how much a small percentage ofour population (probably 1 percent or less) sacrifices for the sake ofthe other 99 percent, most of whom have little idea of what themilitary does. It is especially humbling to see the sacrifices thesesoldiers make when you have just flown from New York or someother place where Americans have very little understanding of thesituation in Afghanistan. I am always deeply troubled by comingupon bodies—either Afghan or American—who have given their lives,their futures. We atDan Rather Reports have probably put in at least as muchtime in Afghanistan as other electronic and broadcast media. I amoften asked where I sleep in Afghanistan. It depends upon where Iam. In Kabul, I try to avoid major hotels. I have a few downscale,out-of-the-way hotels that are comfortable by Afghan standards. Thebig hotels, where the beds are better and the phones work better,are targets. I practice what the security people call “passivesecurity.” You do the best you can. Do not come and go at particulartimes, and change rooms frequently, if possible.There is no such thing as complete security. The point is to breakyour routine. You have to avoid being predictable—or complacent.When traveling in Afghanistan, I find that little personal securityprocedures learned long ago in Vietnam are still valuable. In 1965 Iwas staying at the Caravelle Hotel in Saigon. CBS had an officethere, together with a couple of rooms on the same floor. Because Ihad seen what I considered to be unsavory characters hangingaround the hotel, I was more than a little concerned when it seemedto me that someone had tried to get into my room. After that Ibegan sleeping on the floor, facing the little balcony. On the secondnight, someone—maybe more than one someone—came over thebalcony and into the room, checked the bed (where I had stuffedsome pillows to look like a body) and left immediately. Were theintruders just robbers and thugs, or were they somehow connectedwith the war? I do not know. But I did not stick around to find out. Iwent immediately to another floor and did not have another incident.Ever since that experience, I have tried never to be a sleepingtarget. In Afghanistan, I don’t necessarily stay in the room whereI’m registered. Often enough, I don’t stay in a hotel at all. Afghanswill sometimes invite me to stay in their homes.I believe we have to confront the nonsense of “strategiccommunications,” of American journalists being embedded with U.S.troops and the need to beg permission from the military to cover thewar in a certain way. If this sounds like yet another echo of Vietnam,it should. During the Vietnam War, those in power felt that they couldn’t tell the American people the truth, that we at home couldn’ttake it. They deliberately created a fairy tale about the situation thatprevailed in Vietnam, presuming that if the American people had anaccurate picture of what was happening, they would not supportwhat we were doing. Of course, when the American public finallydidlearn the truth of what was going on in Vietnam, what was beingdone in our name, our worst fears and suspicions were confirmed.As Bill Moyers, a key insider in the Lyndon Johnson White House,recently put it, “We circled the wagons and grew intolerant of newsthat didn’t conform to our hopes, expectations and strategies forVietnam, with terrible, tragic results for Americans and Vietnamese,north and south. I say, ‘Never again!’ ”Except that this isexactly what is going on—again. InAfghanistan, first the Bush administration and now the Obamaadministration are managing the news, and for exactly the samereasons. It is at the core of the Pentagon’s attempt to control theflow of reportage from Afghanistan.There are many formidable problems to deal with in Afghanistan.Of those, three stand out as our biggest obstacles to achievinganything permanent there:•A government that is not only corrupt, but inefficient. HamidKarzai was first elected president in 2004; he was elected to asecond term in 2009, accompanied by widespread and vociferousallegations of fraud at the ballot box. Karzai acceded to U.S.pressure for a runoff election but canceled it on short notice and hadhimself declared the winner. I have spoken with President Karzai fourtimes, and it is difficult not to like him on a personal level. He is verysmart and well educated. He can talk, in English, about a broadrange of subjects—literature, art, music or politics. All I have everseen from him is a gentle demeanor. On the other hand, there is nodoubt that his government is corrupt and inefficient. Although he ison record as being solidly behind efforts to eliminate opiumcultivation, Ahmed Wali Karzai, his late brother (assassinated in2011), was the man behind the curtain in Kandahar, the epicenter of the Afghan drug trade. As a journalist, I am not blind to Karzai’sflaws, and I think it was a mistake for the United States to back himfor the presidency in 2009.•Huge dependence upon opium. Afghanistan is arguably a narco-state, producing 75 to 90 percent of the world’s opium, and AhmedWali Karzai’s assassination did nothing to slow opium exports.Although the United States is striving mightily to promote and evensubsidize the planting of profitable legitimate crops such as grapesand pomegranates, it is tough to compete with poppies for incomegeneration. Moreover, poppy cultivation and the opium trade runlong and deep in Afghan tradition. Virtually no one in Washingtontalks about it, but it is a livelihood for more than 3 million farmers.For the farmers it is basic agriculture, but for many members of thegovernment, both local and national, the opium trade is the expresslane to wealth and privilege. It is also one of the major financialunderpinnings for the Taliban.ForDan Rather Reports, I went to Afghanistan to investigate thepoppy problem with Thomas A. Schweich, the man who was thedeputy assistant secretary of state for law and drug enforcement inthe Bush administration. He went to the major poppy growers andtold them that if they were not willing to shift 60 percent of theirland to crops other than poppies, the American military would burnall of their poppy fields and make them unusable in the future. Heconvinced a few growers in Jalalabad to do so, but President Karzaiopposed the idea and it didn’t succeed.•The Islamic mullahs. Not all, but many of them preach in theirFriday-night sermons that Americans are simply another brand ofinfidel. I am definitely not anti-Islamic, but these clerics are a hard-line group of older men who advocate the killing of Americans. And Ido not think that is right. When we first went into Afghanistan, therewere a few mullahs who understood that we were not there toconquer. We were there to stop the flow of terrorists. Some of thembegan to work with the elders of each tribe, and it is a goodsituation, because the Americans are doing exactly what they want—winning hearts and minds of average Afghan citizens. And both the elders and the cooperative mullahs are getting what they want—money and American expertise.It’s not that we aren’t having some successes in Afghanistan; weare. For the past two years or so, the battlefield situation hasreflected many positives. U.S. and NATO forces have had many wins;the momentum of large-scale combat clearly has swung against theTaliban—not without exceptions, but overall. On the other hand,ambushes and small-scale actions are on the rise. It would appearthat the Taliban is following the time-honored battle plan of theguerrilla playbook. From Mao to Ho Chi Minh to the mujahideen, theguerrilla blueprint is clear:When the enemy is strong, retreat.When the enemy becomes strung out, harass.And when the enemy is weak or off guard, attack.Distressingly, casualties from improvised explosive devices, orIEDs, are also increasing. In the last couple of years, IEDs havebecome the biggest cause of death and injury for our troops. Hiddenin roadside debris, or even in animal carcasses, they are hard todetect because they generally lack metal or electronic parts. It isperhaps worth noting that four out of five IEDs in Afghanistancontain components and chemicals manufactured in Pakistan.We are now trying to train the Afghans to be better able to dealwith the Taliban on their own after we leave. Progress clearly hasbeen made in efforts to build a reliable Afghan army and a nationalpolice force. This has been led by Lieutenant General WilliamCaldwell, who has turned a not-very-good effort around and now hasit pointed in the right direction.Whether General Caldwell and those working with and under himare accomplishing this fast enough and with any real hope ofsustainability is an open question. He believes that they are. He toldme that he is convinced that by the current deadline, set byPresident Obama as December 2014, Afghanistan will have a viablemilitary and police force that can sustain itself. There are many experienced observers who fear otherwise. They applaud Caldwell’sefforts and what he has accomplished so far, even as they doubt hispredictions.A huge obstacle is illiteracy. Statistics vary, but overall literacy inAfghanistan is no greater than 28 percent. For women, it is muchworse: Less than 13 percent of women over the age of 15 can readand write. These already dismal figures mask a wide disparitybetween major population centers, where literacy is somewhathigher, and rural areas, where literacy rates are much lower.Another obstacle is infiltration: Taliban operatives andsympathizers have infiltrated training units and active duty posts,both in the military and police. Extensive vetting reforms have beeninstituted. How effective they are is an open question. (Afghanintelligence services are likewise permeated with supporters of theTaliban, and in some cases with supporters of al-Qaeda.)Nevertheless, there is still reason for optimism in Afghanistan.Over the years, I have known a number of Afghans. They offer twomajor reasons for hope.•The women. Afghan women do not wish the Taliban to return topower. They have no desire to be forced back into total subjugation.Under the Taliban, girls stopped going to school at the age of eight.Beatings and other forms of violence were commonplace, andcondoned. Women were prohibited from holding a job. Today theUnited States is seeking to support and empower Afghan women bypromoting literacy and by recruiting them into paying jobs, includingthe police force.•The hearts and minds. Most Afghans do understand thatAmericans are not like Alexander the Great, the Mongols, the 19th-century British or the Soviets. They are aware that we do not seek tokeep Afghanistan as some sort of colony. Winning hearts and mindsis our main objective, and that’s the biggest thing we have going forus. The current official timetable announced by President Obamacalls for the withdrawal of American combat forces to be completedby December 2014. (The prior deadline had been July 2011.)President Karzai has declared that by that time, his country will beable to shoulder the entire responsibility for both the army and thepolice force.In theory, at that point we should be able to declare victory inAfghanistan, but as was the case in Vietnam, Washington has notdone a particularly good job of defining what victory might look like.It is highly improbable that we will be able to eliminate all vestigesof the Taliban by then, if ever. With the death of bin Laden, however,that is the only one of our original objectives still remaining. Becauseit is far more likely that objective No. 3 will long remain beyond ourgrasp, we are desperately seeking a way to leave Afghanistanwithout leaving the Taliban in power.About the best we can expect is a negotiated settlement, but it isnot at all clear that is possible. Both sides hold numerous mutuallyinconsistent deal breakers. The United States is likely to hold fast onthese issues:• The Taliban would not be allowed to tolerate or harbor anyAfghan or foreign individuals or groups that conspire to carry outacts of violence on other states.• The Taliban would have to accept the current constitution ofAfghanistan as the governing document for all people.• The Taliban would not be allowed to oppose women’seducation, choice of work and freedom of dress.• The country would have to halt all opium production.For the Taliban, it is difficult to see how they would agree toanything that did not include the following three agreements:• A strict and prompt withdrawal of all NATO and U.S. troops fromAfghan soil. • Strict Islamic law—including the subjugation of women—wouldbe the legal system of the land.• Release of all Afghan prisoners from Afghan and Americanprisons.As is apparent, there is not a lot of middle ground on any of theseissues. Despite the deadline, even withdrawal of U.S. troops is likelyto be an issue, since the Pentagon is on record as saying that ourtroop levels will be “conditions-based.” Intimations persist that somesort of American presence will remain far longer than the end of2014, especially if General Caldwell and his successors are unable tostand up an effective, independent Afghan army and police force bythat time.Winning wars is about firepower, willpower and staying power. Thereis no question that the United States can mount formidable amountsof firepower, both strategic and tactical. For a long time, I wasconvinced that if we could marshal the staying power to remain inAfghanistan for 35 to 50 years, as we did in South Korea, it mighteventually be worth it. Since the early 1950s, South Korea hasbecome a functioning democracy and has a relatively thrivingeconomy.It is clear, however, that the American public no longer has thewillpower, and certainly does not have the money, to persist inAfghanistan. Moreover, our citizens are tired of the waste andcorruption, both in Afghanistan and at home. In its final report toCongress, the Commission on Wartime Contracting found thatupward of $60 billion had been lost during the wars in Iraq andAfghanistan through various forms of corruption, including graft,mismanagement, payoffs to warlords and tribal leaders and to theTaliban itself, and to good old garden-variety stupidity.On balance, where do we come out? To date, the war inAfghanistan has cost the United States roughly $450 billion, or$15,000 for every Afghan man, woman and child. Perhaps it mighthave been simpler to have handed each of them a check. CHAPTER 99/11In my head, there is a huge rack of videotapes tucked away in mymental museum. They are lined up like records in an old-fashionedjukebox. Sometimes I’ll deliberately select one out and have it playfor a while—a fond memory of catching the winning touchdown passin a high school football game, of the little church ceremony in whichJean and I were married, or of my first sight of our children whenthey were born.At other times—often at odd, unpredictable times—one will slideinto place unbidden and begin playing. Frequently these are of thenot-so-fond variety, unpleasant things I witnessed in unpleasantplaces: a racial beating in a small southern town, a mortar attack inVietnam, starving children in Africa. One of the mental videotapesthat plays most often is the events from September 11, 2001. Theshock and disbelief, the despair, the sorrow and grief, the anger, andthen—not always, but often—the memories of the bravery, resilienceand determination of my fellow Americans.The most unforgettable events of my lifetime are Pearl Harbor, V-JDay (the day World War II ended), the assassination of PresidentKennedy, the resignation of President Nixon (as leader of awidespread criminal conspiracy) and 9/11. Of those, September 11stands out in my mind as the most compelling story I have coveredas a journalist.That day is embedded in my heart and in the museum of mymind forever. What I was thinking, feeling, experiencing—and most of all what I saw—I will truly never forget.That fateful Tuesday morning at about 8:50, I had finishedshaving and just stepped out of the shower when the bathroomradio mentioned that a plane might have hit the World Trade Center.It was unclear whether this was a confirmed fact, and the earlyspeculation was that it was a small plane. Two things clicked in mymind: First, initial reports are frequently wrong, and second, if anaircraft did hit the World Trade Center, it was potentially a big story,no matter what size the plane was. I was a kid of 13 when a B-25inbound to LaGuardia crashed into the Empire State Building. Thepilot had become disoriented in the fog. That was July 1945, and itwas big news; we talked about it for weeks, even in Texas.I called out to Jean to turn up the kitchen radio and turn on thetelevision. She was already on it; by now she knew the drill. She’shad a lifetime of this: Anytime there’s even the hint of possiblebreaking news, we go heavy into media mode at home. I was hastilyputting on my shorts and trousers as I raced to the small balconyoutside our apartment. We live on the East Side, not too far fromCentral Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Our home is on anupper floor; the balcony faces south and west. Standing there onthat crystal clear blue morning, I could see billowing smoke comingout of the World Trade Center, a few miles to the south. Meanwhile,the radio was blaring bits of extremely sketchy and very cautiouslyworded details. They knew almost nothing, and there seemed to beconfusion about what little they did think they might know.Been there, done that. I’ve been in front of a live microphonemany times when a possible big breaking story hits, and there isalways confusion when the first reports come in. Always. The radiopeople were doing the right thing. They were handling what littlethey were hearing carefully, very carefully. I don’t recall much ofwhat, if anything, television news was doing. At this very earlystage, just before 9:00 a.m. and when half-hour program slots wereending (usually with a slew of commercials), Bryant Gumbel onCBS’s morning show was doing the best he could with what scantinformation he had. But the huge plume of smoke was all I needed to see. It was notclear at this point whether this was an accident or a terrorist attack.From my window, however, I could see the increasing amount ofsmoke. With that much smoke, there had to be a lot of fire, and withit a lot of chaos as well. With Jean’s help, I grabbed a shirt, socks,shoes and a tie and sprinted for the elevator outside our door. “Gotyour hearing aids?” and “Remember to stay steady,” were Jeannie’slast words as I disappeared into the elevator.I was far from camera ready, but at least I had all my movingparts covered, more or less, by the time the doors opened on theground floor. I bolted out of the elevator like a man shot from acannon; I’d have time to put on the rest of my clothes in the taxi. Onthe nearest corner, I hailed a cab. The driver happened to be aturbaned Sikh, one of many who drive New York cabs. I like Sikhs; Ihave ever since I covered the India-Pakistan war in 1965. At thetime, I had roomed with a Sikh family for a few days in Amritsar,India, and visited for the first time their holiest site, the GoldenTemple.I often chat with Sikh cabbies about the temple, their history andthe Indian subcontinent. Not this time. I tumbled into the cab andasked the driver to turn on the radio, tune it to the CBS all-newsstation, and make it loud. He never turned around to look. “Sure, Mr.Rather,” he said.His eyes now shifted slightly from straight ahead to his rearviewmirror, and he smiled. “Recognized you from your voice,” he said.Voice recognition happens more often than I ever would haveimagined when I first became a full-time daily anchor. When one ison television each day, and on for extended hours in the case of bigbreaking news or for long events like election night, one eventuallycomes to realize that voice as well as picture recognition becomescommon. There is, after all, a speaker built into every television set.Not only what’s on the screen, but also the sound coming out of thespeaker becomes embedded in viewers’ memories. Perhaps thisbecame especially true in my own case, because besides doing theEvening News and other television work, I was on radio every day.This included a daily afternoon drive-time radio report of “news, commentary and analysis.” And I had been doing it for a long time:week-in, week-out, month after month, for many years.Nevertheless, no matter how many times it happened, and ithappened quite often—standing behind someone in a line or in a taxi—I was always a bit taken aback, pleased and, yes, humbled andhonored by it. That said, it also made me a bit uneasy. To havestrangers recognize your face in various parts of the country is onething. To have them recognize your voice, especially after only a fewwords, is another.I settled myself in the cab and began to finish getting dressed. Ithanked the driver for recognizing my voice, then added, “I’ll hit youwith a Jackson if you make it to the CBS Broadcast Center in recordtime.” The prospect of a $20 tip had the desired result, and the Sikhinstantly became Dale Earnhardt.We reached the corner of West 57th Street and 10th Avenue, justa few steps from the entrance to the CBS Broadcast Center, fasterthan I would have thought possible. I hurriedly gave the driver hisfare plus his Jackson and jumped out before he had come to a fullstop.I quickly glanced down 10th Avenue. In the far distance, I couldsee large groups of people flooding up from Lower Manhattan. Asecond plane had struck the other tower. At that point I felt certainthat America was under attack, from whom, for what purposeunknown.I rushed up the steps to the entrance. If I had flung the doorsopen any harder, I would have bent the hinges.I quickly dashed past the building security desk and down thelong hall leading into the deep interior of our cavernous broadcastcenter. I got to the newsroom, which was already an anthill ofjournalists—my CBS News colleagues, many of whom I’d workedwith for years. There was no chaos; far from it. There was lots ofactivity, but professionalism reigned. Everybody was worried, but wewere all trying not to show it. By this time, we had confirmed thatthe first plane had hit the North Tower at 8:46 a.m.; the second hadstruck the South Tower at 9:03. What had started as a trickle ofinformation was fast becoming a flood. The anchor desk is perched on a raised platform inside thenewsroom. Beside it is a small pit that holds a mini–control station,where anchor assistants sit while we are on the air. They areelectronically connected to the big main control room in anothersection of the building. They’re also equipped to be in contact withthe nerve center a short distance away within the newsroom itself.In the pit, waiting for me as he had done so often over the years,was my friend Wayne Nelson. Wayne supervised technicians for my“suiting up,” a phrase TV news borrowed from the space program,because the process is akin to a scaled-down version of what anastronaut does before being launched into space. John Readeusually served as my anchor desk “pitman” and all-around assistantfor live, special event broadcasts. John, however, was in Italy andwould be stranded there for several days. Wayne Nelson stood in forhim, as he often had before.Every anchor has his or her own version of the suiting-up ritual. Itmay have been a little more complicated at CBS, because on big,breaking news live events, I preferred to have two earpieces, one ineach ear. This enabled me to be in contact from the anchor chairwith both the control room and the editorial desk, or in this case,desks.I had worked this way for years. I got instructions from thecontrol room in one ear and information from an editorial desk in theother, often while I was on air saying something completely differentto the camera and the audience beyond. I know it soundsimpossible, or at least crazy, but it’s neither. It certainly is not a highskill, but it does require talent and practice, as anyone short of oneor both will tell you. Actually, it’s as easy as simultaneously rubbingyour stomach and patting the top of your head—while also singingthe second verse of “The Star Spangled Banner,” hopping on onefoot and juggling two raw eggs and a cantaloupe.Piece of cake.For me this was a skill acquired and then honed over years ofdoing live, unscripted, extended broadcasts. I started in college, withall of those nights and days doing play-by-play sports at KSAM inlittle Huntsville. I got better at it at KTRH radio and KHOU-TV in Houston, doing more play-by-play, plus covering breaking news, likehurricanes. Once I got to CBS, I spent many years ad-libbing allkinds of live events—election nights, political conventions andinaugurations, as well as disasters and tragedies.Experience breeds confidence. And as you gain confidence, youbroaden and polish your skill set. You also develop a real knowledgeof what you can handle and what you can’t; in short, you develop acomfort zone. It had taken me a while, but by this stage of mycareer, getting information from two earpieces while talking to thecamera—generally without teleprompter or notes—fell squarelywithin my comfort zone. By that fatal morning, I’d been doing it fordecades. Some might say I’ve never been really good at anything,but flying without a net on a breaking news live broadcast issomething I knew I could do, and do well.Wayne watched carefully as listening devices were placed in eachear, then strung down the inside back of my jacket. Jacket off, thenback on. Now a small microphone was clipped to my tie; theattached wires were hidden down my shirt. He checked to make sureeverything was working. I was good to go. Now I was in harness,about to ascend the raised anchor desk platform, get in the chairand go on the air.I made a quick telephone call to Jean at home. Very much on mymind was that she was home alone and that our son, Danjack, andhis family lived not far from the World Trade Center. We were unableto reach him, which was disturbing because about the time theplanes hit, he would have been taking our grandson to hisGreenwich Village preschool.Jean’s voice was full and firm. “I’ve got everything on this endcovered, and what I don’t know enough about yet, I’ll get covered.Go. Do what you have to do. Do your duty. And do it great. We allneed you—your country needs you—to do that now.” Pause. “I loveyou.”I did indeed want to “do it great,” but it had nothing whatsoeverto do with ego. I knew that compared to the responsibilityshouldered by first responders, police officers and firefighters, I hadbut a small role to perform. For whatever it was worth, however, I wanted to do it excellently. All of us in the newsroom wanted to beat our absolute best, and indeed, every journalist with whom I camein contact felt the same way. We were humbled, usually not a wordassociated with most journalists, especially those on television. Butwe were humbled during these times—humbled, but dedicated anddetermined to be on this story as good as we could possibly be.That was it. I said a short, silent prayer and climbed into theanchor chair. I knew I’d not be leaving anytime soon.The CBSEarly Show, at that time with Bryant Gumbel anchoring,is broadcast from a separate, stand-alone goldfish bowl studio onthe ground floor of the General Motors Building, across from thePlaza Hotel in Midtown. That’s about eight blocks from the CBS Newsworld headquarters where I was sitting, and where all other newsprograms originate. A handoff needed to be made, with Gumbel andThe Early Show throwing control of airtime back to me in our newscenter on the West Side in Hell’s Kitchen. The irony and tragedy ofLower Manhattan and much of the city now being a literal Hell’sKitchen did not occur to me at the time. Too much on my mind. Theenormity of what was happening was consuming me.I took the air at about 9:35. This was to be a time, and I knew itfrom the outset, when I would have to fight my emotions. As wasthe case with the Kennedy assassination, I was hit by wave afterwave of personal emotional grief, anger and confusion. This washappening to New Yorkers all over the city, and to Americanseverywhere. It is an absolutely natural human reaction, but I knewthat I could not, absolutely must not, give in to it. I had to tamp itdown, down strong, and down deep. Focus on the job at hand; focushard. Get “zoned,” which is to say focus completely on the one mostimportant thing you have to do. Suppress or seal out everythingelse. Bury it deep inside. Be a pro.For the next couple of hours, it took everything I had to be ableto do that.Soon after I went on the air, we were hit by a numbing and brutallightning sequence of events, nothing less than a seismic jolt to thesoul. With both towers aflame and spewing debris, people facingincineration on the upper floors started jumping to their deaths on the pavement below. Confirmation came that American AirlinesFlight 77 had crashed into the Pentagon. We then receivedpreliminary reports that United Flight 93 was believed to have beenhijacked. There were suspicions that it was headed for the Capitol.A minute before 10:00 a.m., the South Tower of the World TradeCenter collapsed. There was no warning. It took all of ten seconds—there it was, right before our eyes, collapsing in a fiery, smoke- anddebris-filled heap, taking countless lives with it. Surreal. I literallygasped.Four minutes later, Flight 93 crashed into a field outsideShanksville, Pennsylvania. We would eventually learn thatpassengers had rushed the cockpit to battle the hijackers and divertthe aircraft from the Capitol. Not quite 15 minutes later, thedamaged portion of the Pentagon’s E Ring fell in. And less than 15minutes after that, the North Tower of the World Trade Centercollapsed. All of this happened in the breathless span of 48 minutes:9:41–10:29 a.m. From the time the first plane hit the North Tower(8:46 a.m.), less than one hour and 45 minutes had elapsed.It seemed a lifetime. From the pictures we were seeing, and fromthe deluge of reports we were receiving of death, injury, destructionand continuing potential danger, it felt as if we had been plungedheadlong into the ninth circle of Dante’s inferno.I could feel the anger rising within me. It quickly threatened toenvelop me. I’m a Texan, and not just by birth—it’s who I am. ButNew York had been my home for many years. By that Septembermorning, both Jean and I had come to know and love the city. Thatmade the attacks personal. And for me on the air, it created anotherlayer of powerful emotions.I got mad. “Whoever did this must pay!” I thought. My kneesbegan to shake; I was grateful that they were hidden by the anchordesk. I knew I was having a visceral reaction to the scene unfoldingbefore me; I also knew I had to put a stop to it before my wholebody began to quiver.“Get a grip. Can’t let the audience see you quaking. Steady.”“Steady.” It had been one of Ed Murrow’s favorite words, and Iremember him saying it often during his broadcasts from London during the Blitz. Now, 60 years later, it seemed all too appropriate inNew York.“Steady,” I kept repeating under my breath, as rage and reasonduked it out in my gut. “Steady.” In addition to listening to the feedsin both ears and talking out loud to the camera, I was now talking tomyself as well.I managed to get it under control, at least on the surface. All daylong I was the pivot man, conveying the news of the staggeringevents of the day, absorbing instructions coming in through myearpieces, doing on-air interviews and debriefings of witnesses andthrowing to correspondents, experts and officials at remotelocations. My mission was to be an honest broker of information andto present a calm, reliable and resolute face and voice to theaudience.Behind that on-air façade, however, my anger continued tosmolder amidst the constant grief and worry. In addition to myconcerns about Danjack, his wife, and my grandson, I knew thatmany others in the newsroom also had loved ones who wereunaccounted for. There were maybe a hundred colleagues who weredoing their duty while trying to find out what happened to peoplethey cared about. Our director didn’t know where one of his childrenwas; he thought it was more than possible that the child had been atGround Zero. We assigned someone to track down his family andprayed. Meanwhile, the professionalism he and everyone else in thenewsroom displayed was unbelievable.Steady. At times such as these, network news coverage becomesthe national hearth. People gather around television sets to absorbwhat has happened (and what is happening), just as our forebearsdid around fireplaces, as Comanches did around their campfires. Ithad happened with the Kennedy assassination in Dallas, with themidair explosion of the space shuttle, with the assassinations ofMartin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy and during various naturaldisasters, such as big earthquakes and hurricanes, as well as whenpresidents declared or ended wars. As people gather around thehearth, the Speaker—in the television era, the Anchorman (orwoman)—carries the narrative. He or she calls on others and uses pictures and graphics to help but is responsible for driving thenarrative of the story.I was on the air, in the anchor chair, driving the narrative, foralmost 14 hours of that first day and into the wee hours of the next.For food, I mostly lived on energy drinks; I long ago had developedmy own recipe for a blended concoction. Bathroom breaks were few.Too few. When necessary I relieved myself in a version of the old“motorman’s friend,” proving once again that there is no dignity intelevision.I telephoned home several times during the short intervals whenI had tossed to Washington or some other remote. It was a hugerelief when Jean confirmed that our son, his wife and our grandsonwere safe. Danjack had been able to pull his son out of preschoolmoments after dropping him off. Together they saw the secondplane hit the towers. Each time we talked, and the times were few,Jean was reassuring and strengthening. Our family’s GreatEncourager was at her best. Many hours later, we found out that ourdirector’s child was also safe.Pretty much from the first moment, our police, firefighters andfirst responders were constantly in my thoughts. As a much youngerman trying to make myself into a reporter, I had spent a longapprenticeship covering the fire and police beats. From myexperiences in Huntsville and Houston, I knew firsthand what police,fire and emergency crews did, how they did it and how verydangerous it could be. Now, a psychologically and emotionally toxicmix of concerns about those public servants working in the darkheart of the disaster areas, all of the dead and wounded and theirfamilies—so many of them, so very many—was ever present withinme on the air. I had to fight myself to prevent those thoughts fromtaking over.Steady. From somewhere deep in my memory, one of my lateworkingman father’s favorite sayings about tough, challenging tasksfloated up to the surface. “Just keep putting one foot in front of theother. Just keep on keeping on.” It helped.Shortly after 2:00 a.m. on the 12th, it was suggested that I getsome rest. There had always been a cot in my office at the Broadcast Center. I’d often used it to sleep over during one crisis oranother. Initially I said I’d go to it, but then I thought of Jean andhow she and I—symbolically, if nothing else—needed me to behome, for however long it could be. She needed it, and frankly, sodid I.I went home and slept for about two and a half hours, then gotready to go back to the Broadcast Center. “Honey, don’t forget this isa marathon,” Jean said as I was leaving. “You’re going to bebroadcasting day and night for quite a while. None of us has everbeen through anything like this. Pace yourself.” A pause. Then asmile and, “Be great.”As the days wore on, it got a little easier for me to maintain mygame face and stay in the zone. We were on the air day and night; Ididn’t really leave the Broadcast Center except to go home andsleep. And even that wasn’t much. There probably had not been anight when I’d slept more than four hours.When I finally did lose it, it was almost a week later, on theLetterman show. It was David’s first show back on the air after thedisaster. Even then, I stayed in the Broadcast Center till the lastpossible moment, arriving in Letterman’s studio just in time to slipinto the chair beside him. When he is serious, David is an excellentinterviewer. We started talking about 9/11. I was fine, at first—until Itried to quote one of the later stanzas of “America the Beautiful”:Obeautiful forpatriotdreamThatsees beyondtheyears ThinealabastercitiesgleamUndimmedbyhumantears.By the time I got to the gleaming alabaster cities and the humantears, I was overcome. Everything I’d successfully held inside for thepast week welled up in a rush. It was grief—pure and simple. Onedoesn’t apologize for grief, and I don’t apologize for showing myfeelings on the air, but when it washed over me, I was astonished. Itcame as a complete surprise. It had not entered my mind until thatvery moment that all those emotions that I had pile-driven deepdown within me would eventually come back out. I certainly did notexpect them to burst forth so powerfully at that particular time.As we started to get some perspective on the events of that day,I came to realize that for me—and I think probably for others—thefull impact of September 11 was revealed not in any single moment but in a series of snapshots. Beyond the enormity of the towersfalling, there are small scenes I carry with me still:• The images of doctors and nurses gathered outside St. Vincent’sHospital, waiting to perform triage on thousands of wounded. Wewent back to that on the air a couple of times before I realized thatthey were waiting in vain. There would be no wounded, or at leastvery few; those who had not escaped before the towers fell had diedwhen the buildings collapsed.• After the first tower’s collapse, the dedicated CBS Newsemployees—there were several of them—calling in while still tryingto recover from being nearly overcome by the choking cloud of dustand smoke.• After the second tower’s collapse, a woman new to the city toldof having her life saved by a New York City fireman. With fire anddebris raining down and roiling all about, this firefighter pressed heragainst a wall. She could feel his heart beating against her back. Shehad been certain, she said, that this was how she would die.• The heart-wrenching pictures from all over the city of onebroken family after another, many of them young women withchildren, holding photos of the missing and coming to realize thattheir husband and father could not possibly have survived. In somecases, of course, it was a young man with children, realizing that thewife and mother was gone. And for me, multiplying the painfulimpact of these images was the fact that these families were a truecross-section of New York—so many different races, ethnicities andreligions, including Muslims. The killers had been indiscriminate.They didn’t give a damn.These moments march side by side with the big-picture indelibleimages of the first day that are seared into my memory. They andothers that followed in succeeding days deepened our understandingof the attack’s toll. All together they confirmed how great was ourloss, and how great the challenge we now faced. Years before, I had told an interviewer, “Part of growing up isrealizing that not everybody is going to love you.” I had said it in thecontext of becoming a mature and seasoned journalist. Now I wasthinking of a companion statement: “Part of growing up as anAmerican is realizing that some people are going to hate you.” Thereare people—truly evil people, capable of extreme cruelty—out there.They want to kill us, our children and our grandchildren, and theywant to destroy our country and our way of life. They hate all forwhich we stand. That’s a fact. A brutal, hard but true fact. We forgetit at our peril. I told myself that first day, and have tried to repeat itto myself every day since, “I will never, never, ever forget.” For along time after 9/11, when I was still doing theEvening News, Ioften closed the broadcast—especially after some ending reporthaving to do with September 11—by saying, “Lest we forget.”And we had better not. Osama bin Laden himself has beenbrought to justice, but others responsible for those attacks are stillon the prowl. They ache to come back for an encore. I, for one, willbe surprised if we are not similarly attacked sometime in the future.I hope I’m wrong. But that’s not the way to bet it, no matter howmuch we wish it were otherwise.In the seventh grade, back at Alexander Hamilton Junior HighSchool in Houston, a teacher quoted Abraham Lincoln from a speechhe made as a young man, while still a member of the Illinois Houseof Representatives. On January 27, 1838, he told the Young Men’sLyceum of Springfield, Illinois, “All the armies of Europe, Asia andAfrica combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our ownexcepted) in their military chest; with a Bonaparte for a commander,could not by force, take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track onthe Blue Ridge, in a trial of a thousand years.”Why that stuck in my memory I don’t know, but it did. And now itcame back to mind in the context of 9/11. Those who struck us haddone what no attackers had done since 1781, when Cornwallissurrendered at Yorktown. They didn’t drink from one of our rivers orleave footprints, but they surely did leave a shadow.As I wrote in a preface for the bookWhat We Saw: Long ago, when America was still young, Nathaniel Hawthornewrote, “Time flies over us, but leaves its shadows behind.” Fornow and for the foreseeable future, we all stand in the shadowof that terrible, clear morning. We live in a world remade bythe attacks of September 11. Years will pass, and the photosand videos will age and fade. Our memories of the feelingsattached to them in real time will also dim, as they alreadyhave. But echoes continue to reverberate from that date.For more than 44 years, reporting for CBS News gave me a front-row seat on history. When big events occur, they always loom largein the present, but there are times when the television screenenlarges what the perspective of years will show to be stories of onlypassing importance. (The O. J. Simpson trial comes to mind as justone example. Hurricanes, unless they are exceptionally large, strongand produce historic levels of death, injury and destruction, areanother.)Television is a great leveler. The inherent drama of the specialreport, the importance implied by the interruption of regularprogramming and the modern electronic phenomenon of “blanketcoverage” have a way of giving equal gravitas to the variouscalamities that set them in motion. If one were to judge importancesolely by the total number of television news hours devoted tocovering an event, one might come away with the impression thatthe plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr.—John-John—was asimportant a news story as the assassination of his father, John F.Kennedy Sr.This isn’t a question of ranking tragedies but of gauging historicalimpact—the far-ranging repercussions—of an event. And it is rare, inthe fury and haste of the moment, that these historical implicationsare reckoned with accuracy.September 11, however, was surely one of those times. We knewfrom the outset that we were watching history unfold. In real timewe witnessed a line—a shadow—fall over the newsreel of our lives,one that would forever mark the days to come as separate from all the days that had gone before. We immediately understood that wewould remember, and that we would someday be telling ourgrandchildren where we had been and what we had been doingwhen we heard the news.The TV screen did not overinflate the importance of that day, notwhen New Yorkers could see the Twin Towers burning with their owneyes, not when people in our nation’s capital could see a cloud ofsmoke billowing from the Pentagon and not when people in ruralPennsylvania could see aircraft wreckage and a hole in the groundthat, but for the actions of a brave few, might have been a hole inthe Capitol dome. If anything, television reduced those horrificimages to a scale that could be comprehended.Of course, the historical impact of any event depends on thereactions that follow in its wake. The attacks of September 11provoked not only a direct response—or series of responses—butalso a larger and more profound change in how our nation interactswith the rest of the world. From the Middle East to South America,from the Persian Gulf to Central Asia and the Pacific Rim, the war onterrorism now provides the impetus and the context for Americanforeign policy. Indeed, an atmosphere of change prevails all aroundthe world, in ways we could not have imagined at the time of 9/11.Alliances have shifted and continue to do so. In danger zonesaround the globe, there is a sense that once fairly static situationsare again in play. Some historians have compared the state of affairsthat began with 9/11 to that just before the outbreak of World WarI, when the great powers sought political advantage in Europe.Others have invoked the years that immediately followed World WarII, the period of rising tensions that gave birth to the cold war.Whatever the point of comparison, the message was and remainsclear: Our time is witness to a tectonic shift in international relations.Today, the United States is more engaged in more ways with therest of the world than ever before, with the possible exception ofWorld War II. We have never been this engaged with the globalMuslim community. And our economy has never before been sointertwined, so interdependent, on a worldwide basis. Not all of thiscan be directly attributed to September 11, but much of it can. The same can be said about the weaknesses and volatility of oureconomy, which began to be exposed in the latter part of the 21stcentury’s first decade. It isn’t all because of the 9/11 attacks, but alot of it is.Such are the aftershocks that have continued and will continue tofollow the earthquake that was September 11. We Rathers, as onelittle family, and we as a nation were united in anger, fear, grief anddetermination. Resilience, compassion and courage quickly becameour watchwords, our creed—as a nation, as one small family and asindividuals.The attacks of 9/11 changed us as a country, as a people. Muchhas been written and said about the effect of September 11 onAmerica: that it awakened us from our illusions of invulnerability,that it shattered the sense of insularity that complacency,materialism and prosperity had let creep into our national discourse.These observations sting, but there is truth in them. And like somany Americans of all professions, those of us who report the newswere forced by September 11 to reevaluate what we do and how wedo it. For me, for my colleagues at CBS News and for others in thecraft whom I know well, the scale of the story—and the many storiesthat have flowed from it—gave us an opportunity to do the kind ofjournalism to which we aspire. An opportunity and a challenge. It isa chance to perform a public service, to report news that is not onlygripping but that also matters.From what I’ve seen in the years between then and now, it is achance that has been seized upon by much if not most of America’spress. Yes, it was stronger and more evident in the first days,months and first few years after the event. Journalists increasedtheir focus on what was important. International coverage went up,way up. News coverage reflected and informed America’s renewedoutward gaze. And, yes, all of that unfortunately has waned anddissipated some as we enter the second decade after the attacks.But for many journalists it is still there—the intention, the spirit, thedetermination—and within some of their places of employment aswell. We are not able to do it as much as we once did in theimmediate wake of 9/11. But speaking for myself—and I know many other journalists who feel the same—I have not forgotten, nor shall Iever forget. It is in my marrow, part of my DNA, and shall remain so.Not a day passes that I don’t still think about September 11; nota day goes by that I’m not inspired by it. So many gave so muchduring that time and in the wars that followed—including those whogave the ultimate sacrifice—that I find myself constantlyrededicating myself to be the best that I can be, for my country, formy family and for my fellow humans. If that sounds over the top oroverstated, so be it. It’s how I feel and what I try to do.However painfully, we Americans have received an education. Butit has not been an education of the mind alone. Our hearts havelearned much, too. We have been confronted by the courage of thefirefighters, police and other first responders who answered the callat the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon; by the ordinarycitizens who gave their lives to divert United Airlines Flight 93 fromits murderous path; by family members who have to cope every daywith the loss of loved ones killed in the attacks; and by the fightingmen and women who travel far and give so much to defend ourcountry.The exhaustive labors of emergency workers and volunteers atGround Zero have taught us new lessons in loyalty and love. Eachflag-draped stretcher and coffin, every moment of silence, has givenus a new appreciation of the word “respect.” The dry rattle of afuneral drum, the plaintive wail of bagpipes keening “AmazingGrace”—these sounds summon our deepest feelings with a newsincerity and to a degree that might have made us blush in the past.But the past, as it has been said, is a foreign land. It is in thespirit of understanding the distance we have come over the yearsthat we remember—remember the day, and the days that followed,when we were first pulled, blinking and confused and very muchagainst our wills, across the border into the lives we now know. CHAPTER 10Rather v. CBSThe tragic events of 9/11 took place just nine months after GeorgeBush was first inaugurated. The controversy over the Bush/Guardbroadcast came in the fall of 2004, as Bush was seeking a secondterm. Within hours after the outcome was clear, I was asked to leavethe anchor chair. The 15-month period that followed ranks as one ofthe low points of my life, right up there with having rheumatic feveras a boy. In the immediate aftermath of Bush’s win in November, thenegotiations to get me off theEvening News had involved a delicateback and forth about what would happen to me after I steppeddown. The plan was for me to stay on at60 Minutes Wednesday foras long as it lasted, and since everyone knew it was doomed, thensegue to the regular Sunday60 Minutes broadcast. My agent,Richard Leibner, secured a letter of intent, a commitment signed byLeslie Moonves, which said CBS would finalize a new long-termfinancial arrangement with me within the year.Richard thought a lot of Les. Despite everything, in many ways sodid I. Richard kept assuring me that Moonves was trying to do rightby me and that he would take care of me. When Les and I spoke, helooked me in the eye and convinced me that he was sincere in whathe was saying about wanting me to stay with CBS for many years on60 Minutes. I trusted him as a man of his word.I just wish I’d remembered that he’d started his career as anactor. In May 2005, CBS axed60 Minutes Wednesday, which wassupposed to mean that I would be regularly on the air on60 MinutesSundays beginning immediately. Jeff Fager said that it would beimpossible to get me on the air during the remainder of springbecause their lineup of segments was already full. I didn’t like that,didn’t agree and was worried about it. But Jeff said, “Use the time tocome on with a big start in the fall.” That meant I had the end ofspring and all of summer to get a jump on possible segments. I hadbeen part of the60 Minutes team before, but not since 1981. Iexpected it might take a while to work back up to full speed, butthat was never CBS’s plan. My contract stipulated that I was to be a“regular correspondent,” but once I got there, there was nothingregular about it. It was made clear to me on a daily basis that I didnot have the same standing as the other regular correspondents onthe roster.I had trouble getting pieces approved, and those that wereapproved seemed to fall under heavy criticism during the reviewprocess. Whatever we did, there was something wrong with it.In June 2005, I proposed doing a piece on Lebanon. When Isubmitted the proposal, I spelled out exactly what I had in mind.Lebanon was supposedly emerging from the ravages of a decades-long civil war. That past Valentine’s Day, however, Rafik Hariri,Lebanon’s former prime minister and still a major political figure, hadbeen assassinated in Beirut. The massive car bomb that killed himwas detonated in front of a luxury tourist hotel on theMediterranean. Twenty-two others also died.Rumors had been flying about who was responsible. Someblamed Israel’s Mossad. Others accused Hezbollah in collusion withSyria, which at the time of the assassination had about 15,000 of itsown regular army troops occupying Lebanon. Hariri’s murder set offa chain reaction of other political assassinations. The situation wasserious enough that the UN sent in its own commission toinvestigate. The piece I proposed was going to be about whitherLebanon, and why Americans should care. It was finally approved.In July 2005, Mike Rosenbaum, a former CBS Middle East regionchief based in Tel Aviv, and I set out for Beirut. Mike is terrific, everything you want an international reporter to be, and he hadgreat sources in Lebanon. We were there for 10 days. We reportedand shot our hearts out, really dug into the story. We crisscrossedthe country interviewing leaders of all the major factions—Sunnis,Shiites and Druze. We even talked to Hezbollah. We also madecontact with Detlev Mehlis, the German who headed up the UN teaminvestigating the murder. Mehlis was no lightweight. A careerprosecutor, he specialized in cases of terrorism, and in 1986 had ledthe investigation into the La Belle discotheque bombing in Berlin,which ultimately was traced back to Libya. Mehlis told us that heexpected to hand in his special report to the UN in September orOctober. That was great news, since it would correspond with whenwe thought our piece would air.Mike and I put together what we both thought was a dramatic,content-rich segment on Lebanon, its turmoil and its political future,a piece that closely fit the description of the original proposal. At thescreening, Jeff Fager, who was now running60 Minutes, hated everysecond of it. He wanted more of a travelogue. He wanted to seeyoung people enjoying open-air cafés and discos.Travelogue? What I had seen in Lebanon was fresh in my mind.This did not strike me as a good time to encourage vacationingAmericans to hop a flight to Beirut and hang out in cafés.After Jeff demolished the piece, we left the screening pretty muchdeflated. Mike Rosenbaum was mystified. “I don’t know what’s goingon here,” he said.Mike was a friend of Fager’s. I thought of myself as Jeff’s friendas well—I had done a lot for him along the way, as he had for me.Mike and I both knew that Jeff had always prided himself on hisdedication to hard news. In that way, he’s a lot like me. Travelogue?I was baffled enough that I grabbed one of my reporter’snotebooks and wrote down what I believed about journalism.Looking back, it pretty much shows why I was in hot water with CBScorporate.RATHER’S CREED I believe in hard news.I do not believe in news lite.I believe in CBS News.I do not believe in Viacom News.I believe in independent—fiercely independent when necessary—reporting.I do not believe in Viacom’s versionof go-along-to-get-along reporting,Nor do I believe in reporting to serve the corporate interestat the expense of the public’s interest.I believe in news of value to the country,not in news simply for stockholder value.I believe that a news network should not be operatedjust as an owner’s asset.I believe that a news network is a public trust.This I believe.I submitted a lot of proposals to60 Minutes; most were rejected.Those pieces that did get approved were poorly treated. Once theywere in the can, they were aired at odd hours, what you might callwaste-pit country. A piece on Clinton ran the night after New Year’s.A segment on North Korea played on Oscar night. The Lebanonpiece, recut as a travelogue, as ordered, aired the night afterChristmas.For most of those 15 months, I walked around pretty much shell-shocked. I couldn’t figure out what the hell was going on. I becameall but invisible. It was as if I’d gone through the looking glass. Onthe one hand, I was angry and probably more than a little depressedabout how I was being treated. On the other hand, I had my agentsoothing my ruffled feathers, assuring me that “Les is going to takecare of you.”On April 5, 2006, Katie Couric was announced as the new anchorof the CBSEvening News, taking over in September. I had nothingagainst Katie personally, but I had hoped they would promotesomeone from within, someone who had CBS News in their DNA. Butthat, apparently, was exactly what they didn’t want. Publicist GilSchwartz told me that Moonves wanted a break with the past; Moonves himself had said the same thing both publicly and privately.But why? He should have been proud of our history, our tradition,our accomplishments. Instead, he wanted to wipe the slate cleanand forget what Ed Murrow had started.This is where I fault myself. By this time it was clear to everyonebut me that I was being erased. Nevertheless, I refused to believewhat my eyes were seeing and my ears were hearing. I was indenial. Les Moonves and Jeff Fager were no longer behaving like thepeople I thought I knew. I was dismayed; when Les Moonves hadsaid he’d take care of me, I never imagined that he meant it in thePaulie Walnuts/Bugsy Siegel sense of the term.In May, I went to the funeral of George Crile, an excellentlongtime CBS journalist and author of the bookCharlie Wilson’s War,on which the film was based. The service was a reminder to me thatnothing is promised. It was a wake-up call to be more aware of mytime remaining and to use it to the fullest. That realization put me atease about forgoing the golden handcuffs I’d been offered—astipend, a desk, a secretary and an airtight confidentialityagreement; in other words, a vow of silence forever after.I still felt that I had journalistic work to do, but it was clear that Iwasn’t going to get to do it at CBS. “I can see the end,” I wrote inmy notebook, “and the beginning.”By this time there was a new president of CBS News, SeanMcManus, who had added that title to the one he already had ashead of CBS Sports. McManus had been chosen by Moonves, andthere is no doubt in my mind that he had been assigned to get rid ofme. Moonves, however, made the decision. McManus simply carriedit out. He and Moonves got confused in their statements about whohad been responsible, issuing statements that were directlycontradictory. My departure was announced on June 20, 2006, butlooking back, the handwriting had been on the wall for 15 months. Itjust took me that long to decipher it.It was time to get that tattoo off my backside. Shortly thereafter,I reached an agreement with Mark Cuban to produce an hour-longnews show each week, beginning that fall. That story is told in thenext chapter. Even before I started, however, I knew that the schedule was tight, damned near impossible. I became newlyenergized and more determined than ever with all the work to bedone. This was my chance to do the kind of reporting I alwayswanted to do, on my own terms.On the other hand, I had to come to grips with what hadhappened to me at the end. While I was still at CBS, my hands hadbeen tied. After I was gone I had more options, but as soon as Isigned on with Mark Cuban and HDNet, there was little time topursue any of them. That first season I was fully occupied gettingDan Rather Reports up and rolling. By the summer of 2007, morethan a year after I left CBS, we had carved out a little breathingroom, enough for me to stand back and take stock.The intervening months had given me a better perspective. Iknew that there was still a great story in the Bush case, especiallysince the Thornburghers had taken such pains to avoid finding it.Out of my own pocket, I hired an investigator in Texas to lookfurther into Bush’s lengthy unexcused absence from the Air NationalGuard and the curious disappearance of even the most perfunctorypaper trail of his military record during that missing year. Theinvestigator turned up several extremely promising leads, but GeorgeW. Bush was still the sitting president, and after all, thiswas Texas.People continued to duck and dodge, and the investigator hadneither carrot nor stick to make anyone talk with him.Meanwhile, I was hearing troubling stories from former CBScolleagues about bizarre and chaotic goings-on, both in News Divand at Black Rock. Some had to do with the immediate aftermath ofthe September 8 Bush/Guard broadcast, but more were about whathad taken place in connection with the Thornburgh investigation. Irealized that beyond Bush and his vanishing act at the Texas AirNational Guard, what had happened to me at CBS was itself a goodstory. The problem was confirming what I’d been told. Moonves wasstill there; Redstone was still in his aerie. I was stonewalled at everyturn. As my investigator found in Texas, there was no way to makepeople divulge what they knew without the muscle of the judiciarysystem to compel them. For the first time, I began to consider pursuing the truth throughthe courts. I started having conversations with my friend MartinGold, a good and decent man and an excellent attorney, to see whatmy options might be. “More than anything,” I told him, “I want tofind out what happened. Tell me how this would work.”“Expensively,” he said simply.Martin braced me for the idea that taking on CBS/Viacom wouldcost me several million dollars, not to mention a whole lot of mytime. “Do I have a case?” I asked.“Yes, but they will have good lawyers who will mount a vigorousdefense. Once you file, they will be relentless. And it won’t just be inthe courtroom—it’s possible that they will delve into your personallife, and that of your family. And whatever they find, be prepared forthem to use it against you somehow, perhaps evenNational Enquirerstyle. They will harness every ounce of media power they have tomake you look bad. Beyond that, they will do everything they can tospend you into oblivion. It’s not that CBS has deep pockets,” he said.“It’s that they havebottomless pockets. The money they’re spendingisn’t their own. It’s the shareholders’.”“If you were in my shoes, would you do it?”“No,” Martin replied, “but I’m not you. You’re a public person, andthey damaged your reputation.”He surely had that right.It was time to consult the others who would be directly affected—my family. My wife Jean was thumbs-down on it. She has alwayshandled the family finances, and the idea of spending millions inpursuit of something that was stuck in my craw didn’t strike her as awise use of our money. “If you decide to do it, I’ll be right behindyou till hell freezes over,” she said. “And after that, I’ll even cutthrough the ice, but I don’t think it’s a prudent thing to do. Know,however, that if you choose to go forward, I will be your rock, andwe won’t have any more of these conversations. Once you’ve madeyour decision, I will be completely supportive, whatever happens. Nolaments, no regrets.”I made a point to talk to each of our children, separately. Mydaughter, Robin, the lionhearted Rather, did not hesitate. “Dad, this is not a choice,” she said. “You have to do it.”“You need to know,” I told her, “that I’m going to have to spendsome of the money you would otherwise one day inherit.”“Spend every penny,” she replied.I thought my son, Danjack, who is an attorney, might be morecautious. Not this time. Courageous and steadfast as always, heimmediately sided squarely with his sister. “Dad, you’re never goingto be at peace if you don’t do this,” he declared. “Ever since we werelittle, you always said, ‘Don’t back up. Don’t back down.’ You’re theone who taught us never to quit.”“You know, of course, that there are no guarantees I’m going towin this,” I told him.“Some things are worth fighting for, win or lose,” he replied. “Thisis your moment to stand up for all those things you believe in, forwhat you think is important. Go for it.”My family had weighed in; now it was up to me. Part of theproblem was that I had to decide fairly quickly whether or not toproceed—I was running up against the statute of limitations to file alawsuit. It was either do it right away or don’t do it. Ever. It was nowlate summer of 2007, and I’d have to file by the fall.I jumped in the Jeep and drove out of the city to go think it over.There was only one place to go. I headed for the Catskills, where wehave a fishing cabin on the Beaverkill River, one of the great troutstreams in the country. It’s a revered place in the family and a reallyimportant refuge for me. I go there when I need to be alone andblow away all the clutter in my head.It’s isolated, but people can reach me if there is some sort ofemergency. That said, it’s not easy. I know everybody up there; theguy who patrols knows where I am on the river and how to comefind me. Mostly, though, they just let me be, which is exactly what Iwant, and in this case, what I needed.I spent the whole day fly-fishing on the river. I went out justbefore dawn, taking a sandwich. Sometimes I take a skillet with meand grill a trout streamside instead. I fished for three or four hours,then stretched myself out on the riverbank and watched the clouds go by. After that, I fished for another three or four hours—twilight isgreat fishing time.I got back to the cabin at 9:30 or so and opened up a can of porkand beans. At that time, in that place, it tasted as good as the bestmeal any three-star Michelin chef could prepare. Better, maybe.The last thing Jean had said to me before I left for the cabin was,“You’re the only one who can say whether or not you’ll be eaten upby this.”As is nearly always the case, she was right. And what I figuredout there, up to my knees in the cold rushing water, was ultimatelypretty basic. All my life, all I’ve ever wanted to do was to find andreport important true stories. Not being able to do so gnaws on me.My entire career has been about getting as close as I can to thetruth at the core of any story. And now, what was really eating onme was the prospect of closing the door on a piece of my life,walking away from my own story, without ever knowing the truth ofwhat really happened.It’s amazing how clearly you think when life gets down to simplechoices. After a couple of days on the Beaverkill, I drove back intoManhattan and went to see Martin Gold. “I’m all in,” I told him.Despite his strong admonitions to me beforehand, I think that asmy friend, he was happy that I decided to go ahead. “I’ll do my bestfor you, Dan,” he said. “I think it’s outrageous what they’ve done toyou. This won’t be just another case for me.”We filed suit against CBS and Viacom on September 19, 2007.The suit alleged, among other issues, breach of contract,interference with prospective economic advantage, and fraud, basedon CBS’s “intentional mishandling” of the aftermath of theBush/Guard story.We asked for compensatory damages of $20 million and punitivedamages in the amount of $50 million. It was not a number pluckedfrom thin air. We could document what my market value was, bothas a journalist and as a public speaker, before the fall of 2004. Wecould prove how CBS set out to damage my marketability in theaftermath of the Bush/Guard piece. The $70 million was big enoughto get their attention, but it was also intended to be an object lesson, a cautionary sum meaningful enough to prevent othercompanies from doing this to someone else.For me, however, the suit was never about the money, and it wasnever about vengeance. Part of my soul-searching on the Beaverkillwas to look deep inside and satisfy myself that a thirst for retributionwasn’t the driving force. I knew that I would be accused of seekingpayback no matter what, but I was clear in my own heart and mindabout my motives. I filed suit on principle—to find out the truth andto stand up for the importance of a truly independent free press in ademocracy. I genuinely believe that as a journalist, I have anobligation to uphold freedom of the press—especially the broadcastpress—against big government and big corporations. I think alljournalists shoulder this responsibility, but at that moment, I couldsee that I was in a better position than most to do something aboutit.The two inescapable questions rose up before me. If not me,who? If not now, when?With this court action, I was seeking to confront the grave issuesraised by bald-faced corporate and governmental intimidation ofjournalists and by the chilling intrusion of these special interests intonewsrooms across the country. If you believe as I do that a freepress is a constitutional bulwark—in effect the red, beating heart ofdemocracy—then you understand that the corporatization andpoliticization of the press is an issue that endangers the health andwell-being of our country. From the outset, my plan was to donatewhatever was left from my award after expenses to organizationsthat support and defend journalists.In addition to CBS and Viacom, we also named Leslie Moonves,Sumner Redstone and Andrew Heyward as defendants. AndrewHeyward, ousted as president of the News Division (with a verylarge, very golden parachute) and now an unemployed privatecitizen, was included as a defendant because we were alleging fraud.In the law, fraud is a false statement made to induce somebodyto rely on that false statement to his or her detriment. My complaintalleged that in the immediate aftermath of the Bush/Guardbroadcast, Heyward was double-dealing with me a lot, which led me to do things I would not otherwise have done, including apologizingon the air and nailing Bill Burkett to the wall in that grueling three-hour interview. I alleged that there were misrepresentations thatconvinced me not to go forward with actions that I would otherwisehave undertaken, above all the assurance by CBS that it wouldlaunch a thorough and impartial investigation to prevent me fromcommissioning one myself. Heyward obviously didn’t have thehorsepower or the initiative to do this all on his own, but if at youremployer’s behest you hit someone over the head with a two-by-four, you can’t just tell your victim to sue the corporation. You bearsome personal responsibility for your actions.Our suit was filed with the Supreme Court of the State of NewYork. We drew Judge Ira Gammerman to hear our case. JudgeGammerman, since retired, had a reputation for being tough but fair.We knew we wouldn’t get any breaks from him, but we also knewwe wouldn’t get any prejudice from him, either—which is as it shouldbe. Martin was pleased. Of the judges we could have drawn, he said,Judge Gammerman was about as good as we could have hoped for.The sessions were held in the classic New York State SupremeCourthouse, one of the great architectural treasures of New YorkCity. Our forebears clearly understood the importance of symbolism:If you close your eyes and conjure up a stately urban courthouse, itprobably looks a lot like this. Indeed, if you have watched anyepisodes of the TV seriesLaw & Order, you know this building well.It’s practically a mainstay character in the show and is instantlyrecognizable by its graceful Corinthian columns and the long,dramatic flight of steps leading up to it.Inside there is a rotunda, with a huge WPA mural entitledLawthrough the Ages that covers the ceiling. The magisterialatmosphere of the courthouse extends into the courtroom itself. Itlooks exactly like you’d want a courtroom to look. It was a little tattyaround the edges, showing the earmarks of the fiscal austerity ofthe times, but nonetheless still dignified. It was clearly a place forserious business, spare, almost spartan, but not quite. JudgeGammerman had made an effort to soften the severity of hiscourtroom by adding a few plants, an effort that unfortunately was not successful. The plants were droopy and anemic, perhapsbecause the chosen vegetation was never intended to spend its lifeindoors.It didn’t matter. Inscribed in the courthouse is “Equal justiceunder the law.” The entire building, from the exterior to the rotundato the courtroom, reeked of justice, which I found to be immenselyreassuring. Walking in there made me feel humbled, yet proud to bean American citizen, proud that this is the people’s house.CBS/Viacom was represented by a phalanx of lawyers from Weil,Gotshal & Manges, LLP. James Quinn was their lead attorney. Quinnhad been doing this long enough that he appeared every inch likewhat he was. He fit the stereotype perfectly: distinguished looking,early 60s, razor-cut grey hair, expensive, well-tailored suit.Hollywood would cast him instantly as the hired-gun big-timecorporate lawyer.From the outset, he and Mindy Spector, his No. 1 assistant, hadthis peculiar good cop/bad cop thing going. He was poker-faced, curtbut polite—good cop. She was the bad cop—always borderlineinsulting, sometimes over the border. She also had a decibelmodulation problem. On several occasions, her vitriol was so loudand so toxic that Judge Gammerman barked at her, sternly orderingher to pipe down and to behave in his courtroom. Even when silent,however, she seemed to make a point of looking at me with disdain,if not outright disgust—as if I had not bathed since the Nixonadministration. If she’d stuck her tongue out at me, I wouldn’t havebeen the slightest bit surprised.Actually, she got to make faces at me a lot, since I was there forevery court date. Most people involved in a lawsuit leave it to theirattorneys. Not me. I’m a reporter, and one who started his careercovering the courts at that. I asked Martin if there was any potentialdownside to showing up. There wasn’t. There was even a potentialbenefit, he said, so I attended each session in Judge Gammerman’scourt. When I told Martin I wanted to see this through, I meant itliterally.The bulk of Judge Gammerman’s day was taken up with casesthat were further along than ours, cases that were approaching trial. We were still in pretrial motions—and there were a boatload of them—which the judge heard at the close of business, generally from3:30 or 4:00 on. A courtroom like this is a veritable cross section oflegal life in the United States. Martin and I would arrive and wait forour case to be called. Because we never knew whether we would befirst, middle or last, we sat through other cases on the docket inJudge Gammerman’s courtroom on that particular afternoon. Ilistened as the estranged partners in a Chinese restaurant arguedback and forth over a business dispute, followed by a vicious, high-stakes clash between two international business conglomerates,followed by two blue-collar folks wrangling over the ownership of anArchie Bunker house in Queens.Not surprisingly, the first motion filed by Quinn et al. asked thatthe entire suit be dismissed out of hand. He made the argument thatwe were suing for damage to reputation, which the courts generallyinterpret as libel. Libel has a statute of limitations of one year; iftheir argument prevailed, the statute of limitations was already up,and I was beyond my “sue by” date. Judge Gammerman took themotion under advisement but soon turned them down. Thathappened regularly thereafter, and always with the same result.I soon began to see, however, what Martin meant when he hadwarned me about CBS’s strategy of spending me into oblivion. Wedemanded documents from them; they demanded documents fromme. Documents by the tons, including all of my handwrittenreporter’s notebooks from the period. And of course, it wasn’t like Icould just hand over the originals; each page had to be photocopiedand labeled. Some portions had to be redacted, which meant theyhad to be covered up, page by page, before they were photocopied,page by page. Each page in the burgeoning pile had to be assigneda unique five-digit number and stamped “Produced Solely forLitigation.” It cost a fortune, but what we were getting back in returnmade it all worth it.CBS fought us tooth and nail every step of the way—just likeMartin said they would. Martin brought in trusted SNR Dentonpartners to develop the case against CBS. Gary Meyerhoff led thecharge on issues related to the Bush/Guard broadcast, its aftermath and the Thornburgh commission’s report. Eddie Reich and associateRebecca Hughes Parker focused on CBS’s retention of investigatorsto look into the Killian documents and on CBS’s actions afterremoving me as anchor of theCBS Evening News. With this team inplace, we started to make some real progress.One important revelation was the discovery of an unreported e-mail exchange in December 2004 between Thornburgh and WhiteHouse communications director Dan Bartlett, about a month beforeCBS had released Thornburgh’s report. George W. Bush had alreadybeen reelected, and Thornburgh’s law firm had spent several monthsconducting interviews and reinterviews of the CBS News team andother witnesses. In the e-mail to Bartlett, Thornburgh was askingPresident Bush to answer directly, once and for all, the questionsthat had surfaced about his National Guard service.His e-mail to Dan Bartlett, subject “CBS Investigation,” reads:Many thanks for your cooperation in the above matter. As Imentioned by phone, we are in the homestretch of ourassignment and would find it very helpful if we could securewritten responses from the President to the followingquestions so that we can tie up a couple of loose ends. Thesequestions all derive, as you will recognize, from materialcontained in the September 8, 2004 “Sixty MinutesWednesday” segment on the President’s Texas Air NationalGuard Service.(1) Was there a waiting list to become a pilot of the TexasAir National Guard at the time you entered?(2) Do you recall Colonel Killian being dissatisfied in anyway about your National Guard service in 1972 and1973?(3) Were you ever ordered to take a physical in May 1972or at any other time?(4) Did Colonel Killian say in May 1972 that you could doEquivalent Training for three months or transfer? (5) Do you recall being suspended from flight status on orabout August 1, 1972? If so, how was that suspensioncommunicated to you?(6) Why were you suspended from flight status? Was therea reason other than not taking a physical?(7) Describe your communications with Colonel Killianabout a transfer to Alabama in 1972.(8) Did Colonel Killian or anyone else ever inform you thatColonel Killian was being pressured in any way aboutyour status by a superior officer?Thornburgh was asking the threshold journalistic questions thathad to be asked and answered before anyone could legitimately findfault with the broadcast. He was getting to the heart of the matter:Was our reporttrue? He was putting these questions directly to thepresident, and he was doing it a month before his report was to bereleased.Bartlett’s response, more than a day later, was not surprising tome:Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I must say, I wassomewhat surprised by the questions. I guess we viewed yourwork as more focused on what CBS did/did not do regardingtheir reporting, not the substance of their charges. Theanswers to your questions can be easily found in the publicrecord so we would prefer to keep him out of participating inyour report. Please call my office if you care to discuss further.Totally shut down. The answers, of course, were not in the publicrecord. We knew, because we’d looked. President Bush had dancedand dodged whenever he was confronted with questions about hisservice, and Bartlett was the one who was usually sent in to protecthim. In December 2004, Bartlett was not only letting Thornburghknow that he would not be getting answers from Bush to hisquestions, but he also made it clear that the White House didn’t want him meddling with “inconsequential” matters—like whether thestory that caused the whole firestorm was actually true.Thornburgh’s 254-page report, plus 700-page appendix, includesno mention of Thornburgh’s request that the president answer thebasic questions raised by the broadcast. It says nothing about thepresident’s refusal to respond. After everyone had been interviewed,even Thornburgh knew that there were questions about Bush’sservice that still needed to be answered—questions that wereimportant enough to ask a sitting president for written responses. Itwas clear, however, that dealing with the obvious journalisticprinciples at hand was never the goal of CBS News, or ofThornburgh’s investigation. I concluded that their report, aspublished, incorrectly assumed that the story was not true, and thenset out to assess blame.My legal team would also learn about a key Thornburghcommission conclusion that was never mentioned in the report.Martin’s team learned that Thornburgh’s firm was quite aware thatthe vitriolic critiques of the Killian documents—the ones launched inthe Republican blogosphere immediately after the broadcast—werebogus. Michael J. Missal, a K&L Gates partner of Thornburgh’s wholed the investigation, revealed this nugget at a seminar several yearsafter the report was released. On March 17, 2008, Missal was aspeaker at a Washington and Lee University symposium calledMedia, Law and the Courts. During his presentation, he madelengthy remarks about the work of the Thornburgh commission,including the following:It’s ironic that the blogs were actually wrong. When they hadtheir, their, uh, criticism, we actually did find typewriters thatdid have the superscript, did have proportional spacing and onthe fonts, given that these are copies, it’s really hard to say,but there were some typewriters that look like it could have avery similar font there. So the initial concerns didn’t seem tohold up. Ironic?Based on what happened to my career and reputation, not tomention Mary Mapes’s career and reputation, the word “ironic” is agrotesque mischaracterization. With this public statement, Missalwas admitting that he and his law firm were fully aware that the“factual” underpinnings for the attacks on our Bush/Guard piecewere not factual at all.And that they knew it at the time they issued their report.They understood full well that “factual” allegations made by theultra-right-wing blogosphere—allegations that had been picked upwholesale by legitimate mainstream news organizations, includingtheWashington Post—could not be credited. At this samesymposium, Missal described the work of K&L Gates as a fact-findingmission.That’s “ironic.”“What we were trying to do,” he told the audience, “is find outwhat the facts were, all the facts.” Nevertheless, Missal, Thornburghand K&L Gates failed to include many of the key facts they haddiscovered.Our litigation efforts resulted in further progress in January 2008,when CBS was forced to cough up the report that investigator ErikRigler had prepared, a report that also was nowhere to be found inthe published Thornburgh report.We already knew a lot about Mr. Rigler, whose sphere of expertiseis the investigation of aircraft accidents. By any standard, he was anodd choice to delve into the authenticity of the Killian documentsand the question of Bush’s whereabouts during his stint in theNational Guard. Not only did aircraft accidents have no bearing onthe issue at hand, Rigler had been an investigator for the lucrativeTexas Lottery Commission during Bush’s time as governor of Texas.(Questions surrounding the Lottery Commission had been a keyfactor in derailing President Bush’s nomination of Harriet Miers to theSupreme Court.)When Rigler first began his investigation, Andrew Heyward hadcalled Mary Mapes and directed her to assist Rigler in any way possible in his efforts to verify the Killian documents. At the time,Mary was still a CBS employee, and Andrew was still her boss. Asordered, Mary opened her files—and her home—to Rigler, and alsoto his wife, who functioned as his assistant and secretary. JudythRigler accompanied him on interviews. She took shorthand notesverbatim, then typed them up. Those records no longer exist. Afterher husband boiled the information down to a paragraph or two, hedestroyed the verbatim transcript. Destroy original records? As anexperienced investigator, Rigler surely knew better. This is hardlystandard procedure for anyone who had been an FBI agent for morethan two decades, as Rigler had, or who was accustomed to workingwith the Federal Aviation Administration or the NationalTransportation Safety Board.In addition to looking into the authenticity of the Killiandocuments, Erik Rigler apparently had been given a secondaryassignment: an investigation into Mary Mapes’s personal life. As JoeHagan put it in theNew York Observer, “The fact that CBS had aprivate investigator looking into its own employee suggests that wellbefore the panel issued any findings, network management hadbegun to shift its focus away from solving the mystery behind thedocuments, and toward placing blame for the decision to air thesegment.” As unsavory as this was, it was also oddly reassuring. Itmeant that the feeling I got in the immediate aftermath—the sensethat no one but me at CBS was circling the wagons—was not just myimagination working overtime.We learned about the attempt to dig up dirt on Mary throughconversations that took place in the fall and winter of 2004 betweenRigler and Mike Smith, the excellent researcher/investigator who hadworked with us on the original Bush/Guard story. With theannouncement that Richard Thornburgh, George H. W. Bush’s formerattorney general, was going to head the panel, Smith immediatelysmelled a rat. He suspected—rightly, as it turned out—that CBSmight be looking to hang some of us out to dry. Mike Smith was thelink to Bill Burkett, who had given us the Killian documents. (Burketthad become uncooperative with anyone from CBS itself, which washardly surprising.) Because Smith had played such a key role in the story, he figured he might be among the fall guys. As a result, hetaped all of his conversations with Rigler. Secretly.He and Rigler spoke often. On October 27, 2004, Rigler confessedto Smith that he didn’t really know whether he was working for CBSor for the supposedly independent Thornburgh panel. CBS,apparently, was never in doubt. Rigler put that question to CBSNews senior vice president Linda Mason, who was assigned asliaison with Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, Thornburgh’s law firm. She“chewed me out,” Rigler complained to Smith. She then added, “Youshould never talk to those people!”According to his taped conversations with Mike Smith, what ErikRigler was finding out was leading him to believe that the Killiandocuments were indeed genuine. Moreover, like all of us who hadworked on the Bush/Guard piece, he became convinced that theunderlying story of Bush’s dereliction of duty was the truth. “It wasso well known for years at Camp Mabry about Bush and his failure toserve in the Texas Air National Guard,” Rigler told Smith. (CampMabry was where Lieutenant George Bush had been stationed.)“Most people just sort of looked at him as a draft dodger. They didn’thold him in very high regard at all. The story—and I’m talking tosome people at Camp Mabry—the story about the files, the non-service, the memos, stuff like that, had floated around for years. Forthat reason, it makes you think it’s likely true.”We already knew that the issues related to the Killian documentsthat had kicked up the most dust—the typeface and proportionalspacing—were phony. We had manuals for the IBM typewriters inuse by the military at the time in question. Now Erik Rigler, theinvestigator CBS had hired, was coming to the same conclusion wehad—that the Killian documents were genuine.It became clear, however, that the higher-ups at CBS corporateand its parent company Viacom didn’t really want Rigler validatingthe Killian documents, certainly not before the election. OnSeptember 24, 2004, Viacom CEO Sumner Redstone had signaled hisunequivocal support for George Bush’s second term by saying that aRepublican administration was better for Viacom than a Democraticone. On October 5, less than two weeks later, CBS president Leslie Moonves assured a Goldman Sachs media conference that CBSwould not release the findings of the Thornburgh panel until afterthe votes had been counted. “Obviously,” he said, “it should be doneprobably after the election is over, so that it doesn’t affect what’sgoing on.”In other words, CBS seemed to have placed its finger firmly onthe Republican side of the scale. If Rigler had been able toauthenticate the Killian documents that October, it would have beenproof that the man who was now president of the United States haddisobeyed a direct order from a superior officer to take a physicaland was either AWOL or a deserter from his champagne unit for ayear—a year when other young men were bleeding and dying inVietnam. CBS would nevertheless have withheld that informationfrom the American public until after the polls had closed.But after the election, Erik Rigler was out of a job. There was nofurther need for his services. CBS terminated his contract as soon asit was clear that the Bush presidency would last another four years.Rigler himself had predicted as much. “I’m going to be unemployedafter the election,” he told Smith in late October. “Makes me wonderif this whole thing wasn’t so CBS could tell Mary Mapes, ‘Well, wetried.’ ”When Judge Gammerman gave us Rigler’s watered-down reportin January 2008, James Quinn pooh-poohed the victory, suggestingthat we would be disappointed by the contents. Perhaps he alreadysuspected why. On December 8, 2005, Thomas Cowley, managingdirector of SafirRosetti, the security firm that had picked Rigler toconduct the investigation, had sent Erik Rigler’s report to CBS NewsVP Linda Mason. Instead of passing that report on to Thornburgh,Mason supervised the preparation of an abbreviated and sanitizedversion to be delivered to the investigators.So much for objectivity or, in Mike Missal’s words, finding out “allthe facts.” “He [Rigler] was independent,” Mason said, trying to(unsuccessfully) convince Mike Smith in late December. “Well,through me. If we had gotten information, I would have passed it onto the panel.” Exceptthat didn’t seem to happen. Even Mason’s edited versionof Rigler’s findings was not part of the final Thornburgh report.Erik Rigler himself summed it up best in another conversationwith Mike Smith: “This is not a real investigation,” he said.And of course, Rigler was the only one actually tasked withfinding out whether the documents were authentic. Everyone elseassociated with the Thornburgh investigation was very busy figuringout who within CBS News was guilty of putting a true story on theair.Beyond access to Rigler’s report, we wanted access to Riglerhimself. In the courts, discovery is an unfolding process. First we gota little, and then we got more, and everything we got made our casestronger. In March, Judge Gammerman reaffirmed that discoverywas to proceed, even as Quinn repeatedly introduced motions todismiss, which the judge never cottoned to. In April 2008 we weregiven permission to subpoena Rigler for deposition. I was upbeat—finally it looked like we were on the brink of finding out whathappened.The judge did, however, narrow the scope of the suit. Martin hadtold me this was to be expected, since part of Judge Gammerman’sjob was to shrink the case before it went to trial. That same April, hetossed out four of the seven counts in the suit, including the countof fraud. Consequently, he also removed Sumner Redstone, LeslieMoonves and Andrew Heyward as individual defendants, saying thattheir actions had been committed in conjunction with their role asemployees of CBS/Viacom. I understood how that might getHeyward and Moonves off the hook, but Redstone? At Viacom, hewas at the top of the heap. If he was acting in his capacity as anemployee, who was he taking orders from?The good news, however, was that the judge directed that thesuit move forward on the three remaining counts and ordereddepositions to begin. The defendants got the first at bat. I was to bedeposed by Quinn, Spector, et al. Before the session, Martin and histeam spent a lot of time with me, going over the details of the caseand doing mock Q&A’s of the issues that would likely come up. Itwas essential to have the facts “in my frontal lobes,” as Marty put it. The deposition took place at the Weil offices, and they spared noexpense to document the proceedings. In addition to someonetranscribing, there was also both audio and video recordingequipment, everything short of aerial photography. During adeposition, the only people who are supposed to be in the room arethe plaintiff and defendant and their legal representatives. When wearrived, there was of course the cool and collected Mr. Quinn, as wellas Ms. Spector of the perpetually dyspeptic countenance, but therewas also an added starter: Andrew Heyward.I was surprised to see him, especially since he was no longer anamed defendant and no longer a CBS employee. When Martinasked what he was doing there, we were told that he was a“consultant.” My guess is that this was a command performance, aquid pro quo that was buried somewhere in the fine print of his $2million bonus/severance package/nondisclosure agreement.Andrew looked daggers at me throughout the session, and anexcellent job of it he did, too. If the goal was to unsettle me or makeme uncomfortable, however, it failed as a strategy. I was sad for himthat he was hauled in to be there, but his presence didn’t distractme or make me angry. By then I’d been talking calmly at the redlight on the camera for more than four decades—often with all hellbreaking loose around me. I wasn’t about to get rattled by staresfrom Andrew Heyward.After we broke for lunch, Heyward did not return, but Quinnbrought in yet another surprise guest star: Jeff Fager. First Heyward,then Fager. It was a stark reminder of how much had changed.These were men I had considered not just colleagues, but friends. Iknew their wives and families. They knew my wife, Jean. We hadsocialized together. Sitting there in this very adversarial setting, thatnow seemed like a lifetime ago.Martin asked the same question as he had in the morningsession: “What is this person doing here?”“This is Jeffrey Fager,” Quinn said. “He is a corporate executive.”It was all I could do not to laugh out loud. At the time, Fager wasstill the executive producer of60 Minutes. If that made him acorporate executive, then I was the Dalai Lama. For as long as I’d worked at CBS, there had always been a firewall between CBS Newsand CBS corporate—a barrier so solid that the two entities werehoused in separate buildings. And we in News Div were glad of it: Bythe code of CBS News, in which Jeff was ostensibly a true believer,calling someone a Black Rock corporate suit was about the worstthing you could say about a colleague.It seemed to me that Jeff had just taken a giant step over to thedark side. It also seemed that he was not happy about it. If he hadbeen freshly knighted as a corporate exec to get me rattled duringthe deposition, it appeared to have had the opposite effect. Jeffseemed far more ill at ease than I was. His internal battle betweenambition and journalism, which I first noticed during Abu Ghraib,had not abated; instead, it had apparently gotten more intense.What was difficult then had now become anguished. Beyond thebattle for his conscience as a journalist, however, Jeff wasn’t nearlyas good a starer as Andrew Heyward. His eyes didn’t meet mine veryoften. This was not a role worthy of Jeff, and I’d like to think heknew it. (Today, Jeffrey Fager is chairman of CBS News. He retainshis post as executive producer of60 Minutes.)I was excited about starting the deposition process with my formercolleagues, but Martin was philosophical about how much to expectfrom deposing those on the other side. He reminded me that thefirst rule of corporate litigation is damage control. Corporationsunderstand that when a suit is filed, many of those who will betestifying are current and former employees. In the effort to have asmuch control over these potential witnesses as possible, it iscommon practice for corporations to provide free legalrepresentation for those drawing either a paycheck or a pension. Foran individual, this is a great boon, a relief from what otherwisemight be a huge financial burden. For a corporation, it’s just the costof doing business. In most situations, it’s probably a deductibleexpense. The company, of course, chooses lawyers sympathetic toits own cause, often from the same firm that represents the corporation itself. Under the circumstances, it becomes very difficultfor an individual to do anything but toe the company line.Because CBS provided attorneys for Moonves, Fager, Heywardand many others involved in the suit, the documents unearthed indiscovery were key. In deposition, all of the CBS witnesses gave usthe corporate version of “I’m sorry, Senator, I don’t recall.” It was asif they had taken a groupthink vow of amnesia: They wouldn’tremember anything, or admit a single solitary fact unless we couldjam it down their throats with a document that had their names onit. And sometimes not even then.We deposed Leslie Moonves in September 2008. Unlike the restof us mere mortals, however, Moonves got deposed in his ownoffice. How come corporate executives get preferential treatment?Because, I was told, they have big businesses to run and they’revery busy. That didn’t sit well with me. Everyone is busy, includingthe schoolteacher, the single parent and the guy driving the hackwho have to take unpaid days off.“This is the way the courts operate. It’s just the way it is,” Martintold me.“It’s unfair and should be changed,” I told him. “The theory of oursystem of justice is that everyone stands equal before the law.”“Let it go, Dan,” Martin said. “This is not a hill worth dying for.Not now.”We went to Moonves’s office. “Don’t look for any greatrevelations,” Martin warned me. “He’ll be well briefed, and it’s goingto be really hard to get anything out of him. And remember—thesesonofabitcheswill lie.” In addition to the lawyers from Weil, therewas also CBS corporate counsel present.Moonves had obviously been very well prepared. The issue wasraised of the agreement that had been reached with my agent,Richard Leibner, to extend my contract and to keep me on at60Minutes, and the letter of intent that Moonves had signed to thateffect. Moonves acknowledged that he had signed that document,but he maintained that it was not a contract and that he’d onlysigned it to get Leibner off his back. He said he never considered itbinding and never had any intention of honoring it. In other words, his signature meant nothing. Score one foromertà. I’m not going to accuse Leslie Moonves of lying, but I willaccuse him of being so blatantly mistaken it would be hard to thinkthat someone of his intelligence and experience would do that.When it was over, Moonves came around the table toward me,bouncing and smiling, as if it had all been a great lark. He extendedhis hand. I shook it; I thought it was the gentlemanly thing to do. Ididn’t feel good about it, but I did it, even as I looked forward to himraising that very same hand at trial, being sworn in before JudgeGammerman, and trying to get away with repeating what he’d justsaid.Martin had warned me to be prepared for smears in the press.His law firm had a team of people working to protect my reputation,but CBS was working equally hard to slam it. Instead of making mea villain, from the outset their strategy was to portray me as somesort of addlepated pensioner, a pathetic old fool hell-bent on ruininghis legacy. Lead attorney James Quinn had condescendingly calledthe lawsuit one of those “sad cases where a person at the end of hiscareer wants to go back after people he feels mistreated him.”Remarks like that from Quinn were to be expected, but I wassurprised by the barbs flung by former colleagues. Morley Safer saidI was suing because I enjoyed being a martyr. Jeff Fager told theWashington Post that I was “in some paranoid nightmare whereeverybody is out to get him. We’re all witnessing the poor guythrashing around, tormented… I can’t for the life of me understandwhy he’s doing this, how he could turn such a storied career into thistrain wreck.”In that climate, it clearly would have been self-destructive toanyone’s career within CBS News to support me publicly. To formercolleagues who kept their silence: my gratitude. And to those whocalled me on the QT to offer their tacit support: Thanks, I neededthat. You know who you are.A lot of my being painted as a doddering, deranged Don Quixote,tilting at imaginary windmills, evaporated when the flood ofdocuments we won in discovery started coming to the surface.Judge Gammerman had made it clear that he wanted the case tried in the court, not in the press. As a result, we were barred fromreleasing any documents to the public, except those that had beenfiled in court.Just so. Martin Gold, Gary Meyerhoff and Eddie Reich filed lots ofmotions, and in support of those motions, they attached documents.That put them into the public record. In November 2008, adocument attached to one of their court filings got everyone’sattention—Exhibit J.Exhibit J was the short list of names that CBS executives hadcompiled in mid-September 2004. These were the nominees theyhad considered to head up the “independent, impartial” panel.Among others on the list were Tucker Carlson, Pat Buchanan, MattDrudge, Bernard Goldberg, Lou Dobbs, Ann Coulter, CharlesKrauthammer and Rush Limbaugh. Scrawled at the bottom was thename of one additional write-in candidate: Roger Ailes, head of FoxNews.Round up the unusual suspects.All were longtime Bush supporters and sympathizers. There wasnothing independent about them. There were also a few morereasonable candidates on the list, including former senator WarrenRudman (R-New Hampshire). According to a CBS in-house memo,Rudman was “mentioned by several GOP folks who feel he is abovereproach, and he would be his own man.”Which is exactly what was wrong with him. Rudman was rejectedbecause he would not, in the words of CBS News senior vicepresident Linda Mason, “mollify the Right.”The disturbing picture emerging from the documents won indiscovery was that executives at the highest levels of CBS News,including both VP Linda Mason and president Andrew Heyward,seemed in a veritable tizzy, trying to “mollify the Right.” After thatstellar list of potential candidates was drawn up, Heyward andMason vetted the names on it with Viacom’s top Washingtonlobbyist, Carol Melton. As a lobbyist, Melton was in good stead withthe Republicans, having funneled more than 60 percent of Viacom’s political action committee contributions their way. She proceeded torun the nominees by her contacts within the Republican Party. Fromthe feedback she got, this was how Richard Thornburgh came outthe winner. Melton “did some other testing,” Linda Mason’s notesrevealed. “T [Thornburgh] comes back with high marks from G.O.P.”I was absolutely horrified. In bringing suit, we had charged thatCBS’s actions were committed to appease angry Republicans and toadvance the financial interests of Viacom. Now it was clear that CBSNews was no longer simply part of Viacom. It had become thewholly owned subsidiary of the Bush administration.This was not the CBS I knew. And it was not the Andrew HeywardI thought I knew. Heyward’s faintheartedness and his desertion ofhis own staff—not to mention the abandonment of his own ethics—stood in sharp contrast with the behavior of Richard Salant, who hadbeen president of CBS News when I was chief White Housecorrespondent. All through Watergate, Salant never wavered. Wenever doubted that he had our backs, even though we knew that thepressure on him was intense. Richard Salant stood up for hisjournalists, not only to the Nixon administration, but to William S.Paley himself.Salant was also president of News Div in 1971, when we airedThe Selling of the Pentagon. The documentary, which was accuratein the overall, actually had some errors and flaws—enough to bringus under sharp attack in the House of Representatives. Two powerfulsenior members of the House, Harley Staggers (D-West Virginia) andF. Edward Hébert (D-Louisiana), were the most upset. Hébert,chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, vilified ourdocumentary as “un-American” and “Goebbels-like.” Largely at hisinstigation, the Investigations Subcommittee of the HouseCommerce Committee, headed by Staggers, started looking into howCBS News had produced the documentary. They issued a blanketcongressional subpoena demanding that we furnish “all film, workprints, outtakes, and sound-tape recordings, written scripts and/ortranscripts” from the program.For the broadcast media, this was equivalent to asking a printreporter to give up a source, and for upstanding journalists, that is simply not done. CBS Network president Frank Stanton—the LeslieMoonves of his day—pretty much told Staggers and Hébert to stick itwhere the sun don’t shine. He gave them the finished version of thedocumentary, nothing more. They screeched and threatened, butStanton remained resolute. To defend our First Amendment rights asjournalists, the head of the network defied the subpoena, and in sodoing risked a contempt of Congress citation and possible jail time.Stanton and Salant. Moonves and Heyward. Sadly, they don’tseem to make network executives like they used to, at least not atCBS.Part of what was different now, of course, was that CBS was nolonger a freestanding company. CBS had become a cog in theGreater Viacom Empire. CBS News may have been one of the best-known entities within that huge conglomerate, but in terms ofcommercial value, it ranked well below a host of Viacom’s otherassets. This had been true in the days of Stanton and Salant as well.CBS News was never the most profitable component of what wasthen known as the Tiffany Network—there were years when it wasn’tprofitable at all—but Bill Paley didn’t care about that. He wasn’tperfect when it came to news. He had his weak moments and madehis mistakes. But he was as good an owner in this regard as therehas ever been; I think the best. Not only was he a true believer inthe idea that the news was a public service, he also understood thatCBS News contributed to the bottom line in crucial but intangibleways. CBS News added value and prestige to the network by virtueof its excellence. In contemporary marketing lingo, when it came toefforts to build the brand, CBS News did a lot of the heavy lifting.CBS News also satisfied an important legal requirement. Underthe rules of the FCC at the time, every few years networks had tojustify their broadcasting licenses. To be renewed, they had to showhow their programming was in the public interest. CBS News was thenetwork’s ticket to fulfilling that function.In the headlong rush to deregulation that began during theReagan administration, however, that requirement was eliminated. Inlate 2004, in the deregulated Wild West of pro-business Washington,Viacom had a much larger agenda, which is to say that Sumner Redstone thought the company needed to get bigger and moreprofitable. The Viacom empire was already full of cash cows. Inaddition to CBS, Viacom also owned MTV, Showtime, Nickelodeon,TNN, BET, TV Land, UPN, Comedy Central, Infinity Broadcasting andVH1, as well as Simon & Schuster, King World Productions (whichsyndicatedJeopardy!,Wheel of Fortune andThe Oprah WinfreyShow) and Paramount Pictures. Viacom was also accruing localtelevision stations around the country.In that lineup, CBS News was about as important as a nit on agnat’s nut. At the time, the lucrative permissions and licenses thatViacom was seeking were actually worth more than CBS Newsin itsentirety. So, too, was the right to own increasing numbers oftelevision stations, an issue that had been percolating in Congressduring the two years before the Abu Ghraib and Bush/Guardbroadcasts had aired.An FCC rule known as the broadcast ownership cap restrictedViacom and other media behemoths from owning television stationsthat reached more than 35 percent of the country’s households. TheRepublican-controlled FCC had raised the cap to 45 percent, the typeof deregulation Sumner Redstone was endorsing. Democrats in theHouse and Senate were preparing legislation to push the cap backdown to 35 percent. If that effort was successful and the cap wasrestored to 35 percent, Viacom would have had to start selling offtelevision stations. That would have made Mr. Redstone mostunhappy. The battleground for this dispute was to be the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee, which had FCC oversightresponsibility. At the time, the ranking Republican on that committeewas Congressman Roy Blunt (R-Missouri), then the House majoritywhip.Viacom hired the big Washington lobbying firm Cassidy &Associates to lobby Energy and Commerce. Who would lead thecharge? Mr. Blunt’s former chief of staff, Gregg Hartley. Hartley leftBlunt’s office, joined Cassidy & Associates and immediately startedearning money by lobbying his former boss—Roy Blunt. That’spolitics, Washington style. Among the other associates at Cassidy isAndy Blunt, Roy Blunt’s son. That, too, is politics, Washington style. When the dust settled, the committee struck a deal to set theownership cap at 39 percent, the exact percentage of households inViacom’s portfolio. Blunt and the Republicans in the House hadhelped Viacom keep its television stations.On September 15, a week after our Bush/Guard broadcast, it wasthe same Congressman Blunt who had come out strongly attackingthe story. He wrote a stinging letter to CBS News, specifically topresident Andrew Heyward.Dear Mr. Heyward:We are writing to express our dismay that CBS has becomepart of a campaign to deceive the public and defame thepresident… We urge CBS to retract its story, and to disclosethe identities of the people who have used your network todeceive your viewers in the final weeks of a presidentialelection.On January 10, 2005, five days after the final Thornburgh-Boccardi report was made public and ten days before Bush’s secondinauguration, internal CBS documents show that Viacom lobbyistCarol Melton strongly urged Andrew Heyward to comply withCongressman Blunt’s earlier request. Specifically, she wanted him toofficially retract the Bush/Guard story. Appeasing Blunt was apriority, and not just because he was a major player on the Energyand Commerce Committee. Although Blunt was House majority whipunder Majority Leader Tom DeLay, Melton made it clear that Bluntwas speaking for an even more powerful constituency—the WhiteHouse. “Plainly the ‘retraction’ point per se seems to be a final shoethat some would like to see drop,” she wrote to Heyward, “and haveno doubt that Blunt is acting as the mouthpiece for thisadministration.” Keep in mind that this is a corporate lobbyistpressuring the head of the News Division. That should never havebeen happening. And at my time at CBS, I never knew it to havehappened before. At Ms. Melton’s deposition more than three years later, she didnot deny it. “The White House was not engaging on this directly…Mr. Blunt was serving as the outside spokesperson, if you will, toexpress a point of view… for the Bush administration… That was hisrole.”Heyward did not want to issue a formal retraction on top of the“apology” I had already made. In an e-mail to Melton, Heywardacknowledged to her that the Bush/Guard story was a true story butadded, “I would never say this publicly.”Wow. Way to stand up. This is the same guy who clearly wasreceptive to lobbyists giving President Bush, his surrogates andsupporters the kind of pseudo-independent investigation theywanted, who cast his reporting team adrift and attempted todistance himself from the entire process.It was Leslie Moonves who cast the deciding vote on the“retraction” issue. Howard Kurtz quoted Moonves in a January 11,2005,Washington Post story. “Moonves said it is clear that CBS hasretracted the story.” That surely was not clear to me. It was not evenclear to Andrew Heyward. I had apologized for including the Killiandocuments in the broadcast. We did not retract the story, nor shouldwe have. But that was the way that Blunt and the White Housewanted it, and Moonves chose to oblige.In November 2004, two weeks after election night, lobbyistMelton had received a promotion from Sumner Redstone, becomingViacom’s executive vice president for government relations. In June2005, about seven months later, she jumped ship to become alobbyist for Time Warner. In October she named Tim Berry as herNo. 2. Berry had been Tom DeLay’s chief of staff, but DeLay wasfacing big-time legal trouble. When DeLay was indicted onSeptember 28, he stepped down as majority leader. On an interimbasis, that position went to… Roy Blunt. Blunt was thought to be thefront-runner to win the position permanently but narrowly lost out toJohn Boehner the following summer.Like DeLay, in 2005 Blunt had been named as one of the mostcorrupt members of congress by CREW, the Citizens forResponsibility and Ethics in Washington. Blunt was so honored again in 2006. What did he do that upset CREW? Like his predecessor,Blunt was tied to Jack Abramoff. He also attempted to push throughspecial-interest legislation for Philip Morris at the behest of itslobbyist, Abigail Perlman (soon to become Abigail Blunt), neglectingto reveal that the two had a close personal relationship.In 2003, Blunt had assisted his son Andy, at that time a lobbyistfor FedEx and UPS, by inserting a provision into an emergencyappropriations bill for the war in Iraq stipulating that military cargomust be carried by companies with no more than 25 percent foreignownership. FedEx and UPS were seeking to thwart inroads into theirbusiness by a foreign-owned competitor. Both contributed heavily tothe Blunt campaign in the years that followed.Beyond that, however, Roy Blunt played a crucial role in what wasknown as the “K Street Project,” a concerted effort to press DClobbyists to wholeheartedly align themselves with the Republicanagenda in order to gain access to influential officials. Blunt was amaster at it. As described by Thomas Edsall in theWashington Postin May 2005, he was a Republican fund-raising machine. “Blunt hasconverted what had been an informal and ad hoc relationshipbetween congressional leaders and the Washington corporate andtrade community into a formal, institutionalized alliance,” Edsallwrote. “Lobbyists are now an integral part of the Republican whipoperation on par with the network of lawmakers who serve asassistant whips… [Blunt] became the House GOP’s key liaison withthe lobbyists who not only represent clients in virtually everymember’s district, but also direct the flow of individual and politicalaction committee contributions from the 1,600 corporations and1,200 trade associations with PACs.”The K Street Project was based on the principle of “reward yourfriends; punish your enemies.” Viacom is nothing if not profit driven.The top priority of the company is to protect and expand its financialinterests. If honest reporting threatens that in any way, it’s going tocome out second best. No wonder Viacom tried to bury the story—and the journalists involved. CBS News was messing up their agendain Washington. The bizarre connection between CBS and Roy Blunt did not endthere. Today, Roy Blunt is no longer a congressman; he is now thejunior senator from Missouri. Elected in 2010, he received campaigncontributions from a wide range of businesses and individuals.Among those individuals was Leslie Moonves, who donated $2,400to Friends of Roy Blunt and $5,000 to the Rely on Your Beliefs Fund(ROYB), Blunt’s political action committee. Moonves also contributed$5,000 to the Missouri Republican State Committee. Bycontemporary campaign finance standards, this may strike some aschump change. What makes it unusual, however, is that prior to thistime, other than a 2009 donation to the CBS Political ActionCommittee, Les Moonves had not made a political contribution inmore than a decade. Stranger still, prior to the year 2000, all of hiscontributions were to Democrats. Perhaps getting Blunt into theSenate was the only way to get him off the Energy and CommerceCommittee.In July 2009, Judge Gammerman granted us access to moredocuments, including a lot of material from K&L Gates, which wasthe new name of Richard Thornburgh’s law firm. (When theinvestigation, such as it was, was being conducted, his firm hadbeen known as Kirkpatrick & Lockhart. In 2007, it merged with theSeattle-based law firm Preston Gates & Ellis—the “Gates” beingWilliam H. Gates Sr., father of Microsoft’s Bill Gates.) When we sued,a lawyer from K&L Gates balked at our request for their documents,trying to plead attorney-client privilege. Judge Gammerman ruledagainst them.The judge ordered the firm to surrender them within ten days. Inaddition to e-mail communications, memoranda, drafts of the reportand notes, we had also asked for transcripts from the interviews K&LGates had conducted during their investigation.There weren’t any.K&L Gates claimed it had no transcripts, no audiotapes, zilch.Martin and I were in disbelief. Despite billing CBS more than $2.2million for conducting the investigation and for follow-up work after delivery of the report, attorneys from the high-powered law firmheaded up by the former attorney general of the United States, oneof the largest firms in the country, claimed it kept no official recordsas they talked to witnesses.Depositions of Thornburgh’s partner Mike Missal and othersrevealed even more. K&L Gates did have lawyers take notes duringthe investigation’s interviews, but Mr. Missal testified at hisdeposition that the note takers were instructed todestroy theirinterview notes. They were also instructed to destroy any drafts ofthe report that had existed. I found this even more peculiar thanRigler’s destruction of verbatim transcripts. Why would lawyersdestroy evidence?Missal must have known this looked very bad, and he did notwant the blame. He testified that he had been instructed to “notmaintain any drafts” of the report by Linda Mason, at the time CBS’svice president for public affairs. Ms. Mason did not want the blameeither. At her deposition, she testified, “I never gave thatinstruction.” Well, someone did. CBS was seeking to remove itsfingerprints from Thornburgh’s “findings,” and Missal and companyhad done so, even if no one would own up to who had given theorder.Judge Gammerman also restored our claim of fraud. At the sametime, he told both sides that he was pushing to go to trial within fourmonths.Game on. I was elated. Gammerman was well known for movingthings along. He didn’t like things to drag in his courtroom, and thepretrial phase of this case had already gone on for almost two years.I was even happier two months later. On September 21, heapproved several key depositions, including Dick Thornburgh,Sumner Redstone and even Dan Bartlett. That, I suspect, set offmajor alarm bells in Black Rock and in Washington. Our next datebefore Judge Gammerman was set for December 22.We never got that far. By this time there was already aconsolidated appeal on file with the Appellate Division of the NewYork Supreme Court. In New York, unlike most other states in thecountry, it is not necessary to wait until the end of a case to file an appeal. Almost any decision made by the judge along the way canbe kicked up to appellate court. In our case, this is what happened.Appeals of decisions by Judge Gammerman were made. Quinnappealed everything that had gone badly for them. We appealedwhat was unfavorable to us.I attended the day the appeals justices heard the case in opencourt. Right from the start, it seemed to me that the justices treatedQuinn almost deferentially. With Marty they appeared to beimpatient and often dismissive. Watching as this conduct continued,my hopes began to sink. “We haven’t got a chance,” I thought.Marty had the same assessment of the judges’ demeanor butwasn’t sure how much to read into it. “Well,” he said, “they seem tohave their minds made up, but with appeals courts, you neverknow.”As the session ended, I looked for a reason to be at least a littleoptimistic. “For one thing,” I thought, “there is no way they can ruleagainst what CBS had promised contractually about using me as aregular correspondent on60 Minutes, and what Moonves hadpromised me in person and in writing.”Wrong.On September 29, about a week after Judge Gammermanindicated we were going to trial, the appellate court threw out thecase. Completely.My CBS contract had a “pay or play” provision; the appellatejustices ruled that as long as CBS paid me according to my contract,which they had, I had absolutely no grounds to bring suit.“Contractually,” wrote Judge James Catterson, who authored theunanimous opinion, “CBS was under no obligation to use Rather’sservices or to broadcast any program so long as it continued to payhim the applicable compensation.” They stopped in its tracks theeffort to let a jury decide anything in the case. They gave CBS a bigvictory. Marty called it one of the worst defeats he’s ever had as alawyer. The judges maintained that all that mattered was that I waspaid. Not whether I ought to actually be on the air. Not whether theytold me—or their viewers—the truth. The five justices who heard the case were Luis Gonzalez, JohnBuckley, James Catterson, James McGuire and Dianne Renwick. Allbut Renwick had been appointed by former Republican governorGeorge Pataki. There are twenty judges in the First Department ofthe Appellate Division. The process by which justices are assigned tocases is not transparent, but in theory it is random. In theory. Whatare the odds that these five, who among the twenty were by far themost likely to be sympathetic to CBS, turned out to be the ones whoended up hearing the case? Let’s put it this way: If a pile of sand isdumped on a table, and when it lands, it happens to spell out “Nicetry, Rather, but we can’t risk this going to trial,” that’s random. Intheory.I was of course disappointed by what happened. Nevertheless, Ihave never second-guessed myself about the decision to go to court.It took a big whack out of my time, my psyche, and my bankbalance, but even so, it was worth it. The suit accomplished much ofwhat I set out to do. I filled in some of the key blanks in theBush/Guard story and my role afterward. More important, the suitforced some of the really ugly truths about what CBS was doingbehind the scenes out into the open. To find out that the presidentof CBS News had been dancing to the tune of a Washingtoncorporate lobbyist was beyond anything I might have imagined. Ifyou believe that politics and corporate influence are not heavilyinvolved in the appointment of judges and how they rule, you’reentitled. I believe they are. I also believe that they were factors inmy case being stopped short of trial by jury.Somewhere out there are a lot of people who know firsthand thetruth of what we reported about what Bush did and didn’t do in themilitary. But they remain silent. So far.I know the suit pissed off a lot of people. It seems I’ve beendoing that all my life, but journalism is not a business to get into ifyou have no stomach for making people angry. One of my reasonsfor writing this book is to show exactly what was at stake and whatfacts were gained by doing it. When you report something important for the public to know that somebody in power doesn’t want out inthe open, someone’s bound to get mad. Perhaps my friend BillMoyers put it best:News is what people want to keephidden.Everything else is publicity. CHAPTER 11Reinventing Dan RatherBy the spring of 2006, I was out at CBS. It was not how I wanted togo out, not at all how I’d envisioned leaving the network, but by thistime even my last, try-to-the-end hopes had been dashed. I wasdeeply disappointed but not bitter about having to leave. By anymeasure, I’d had a good run. As much as anything, I was in a fog.When I was in the office in the final days and weeks, I was therephysically, but I suspect my eyes were often glazed over, becausemy head was surely elsewhere. Various recollections of my time atCBS continually washed over me, like waves hitting a beach.Recordings from that jukebox in my mental museum replayedthemselves at random. Someone had put a lot of quarters into thatjukebox—44 years’ worth, 24 of them in the anchor chair. Whatplayed was not just Rather’s Greatest Hits. Some memories weregood and some were not, but I had nothing to do with making theselections—these B-roll video clips from my past cued themselves uppretty much on their own.As the end neared, I felt the stirrings of a fledgling identity crisis.I had tried so hard for so long to be the quintessential CBS Newscorrespondent that it had become much of my identity. Maybe toomuch. “Dan Rather, CBS News” was more than just my sign-offtagline at the end of a broadcast. In my head, “Dan Rather” and“CBS News” had been welded together for so long that they hadbecome fused—DanRatherCBSNews.That was my name.If I wasn’t that, who and what was I? I went through my last day pretty much in a daze. After going outthe door for the last time, I walked home through Central Park. Thatgreat, green oasis in the middle of Manhattan was restorative, as itso often is. As I walked, the fog in my head began to lift a bit; mysenses perked up. I became alert to my surroundings—I stopped tosmell the flowers and listen to the birds. As I did so, I wasoverwhelmed by a feeling of gratitude. “You are lucky and blessed,Dan. Don’t forget it.”Close on the heels of gratitude came a self-administered pep talk.“You’ve been knocked down,” said that persistent inner voice. “Don’tstay down. You’ve always said you are a get-up fighter… Okay, nowprove it.” It might have felt more like the beginning of resilience if I’dbeen able to tell myself just how that might be done.When I got home, Jean was all smiling and loving and full ofpositive energy. “Well,” she said, “this day is the start of a newadventure.” That wasn’t how it felt to me—it still seemed much morelike an ending, not a beginning. When I didn’t immediately brightenup, she tried another approach. “Sit down,” she said. “Let’s have aglass of wine.”I knew the wine would be excellent—Jean likes wine and knows alot about it—but I had something else in mind. “If you don’t mind,I’d prefer a straight shot of bourbon.”“How could I mind?” she asked as she poured two jiggers froman old bottle of Wild Turkey into a glass.For a few minutes, neither of us spoke much. Then, gently butfirmly, Jean gave me a quiet talk about love, family and friends,about being a husband, father and grandfather; in short, aboutwhat’s really important in life. “You were a helluva man before youever got to CBS,” she said, “and you’re an even better one now.”Among all my blessings, she’s at the top. As always, Jean knewexactly what to say and how to put the end of my time at CBS intoperspective. After that I was no longer down, but I surely was atloose ends.My friend and agent of 40 years, Richard Leibner, had tried to findme another job. I made it plain to him that the compensation wasn’tthe important thing; I had no expectation of drawing the kind of salary I’d had at CBS. Several other network news executives initiallyexpressed interest, but after discussing it with the higher-ups inmanagement, they all had the same answer: “Dan, you’re a lightningrod. You are too hot to handle.”Once again, I was at a turning point in my career, as I had beenso long ago. Early on, it always seemed to be the case that guidesand mentors turned up out of the blue to help me. When I was afreshman at Sam Houston State Teachers College, journalismprofessor Hugh Cunningham had come along when I wasfloundering—and damned near foundering—and he got there justwhen I needed him most. Cal Jones at KHOU had taken me straightout of radio; when I started working for him, I was a guy who knewnothing about television. He taught me everything he knew, whichwas plenty; under his guidance I became an on-air reporter goodenough to get hired by CBS in New York.Now, decades later, my out-of-the-blue moment arrived courtesyof George Clooney. I first met George when I profiled him for60Minutes II. I realized immediately that he was a lot more than justthe second coming of Cary Grant. Now he was to receive an awardfrom the Writers Guild for the movieGood Night, and Good Luck,and he had invited me to Los Angeles to present it to him. Set in the1950s, this excellent film deals with the period at CBS when EdwardR. Murrow and Fred Friendly stood up to Joseph McCarthy. Clooneywas deeply involved in all aspects of the project. He not onlyportrayed Friendly to David Strathairn’s Murrow, he also wrote anddirected.George put me up in a first-rate hotel. At the gala, I sat with himand his agent. They couldn’t have been warmer or more genuine.Clooney never said anything about CBS or the Bush/Guard broadcastor the Thornburgh report, except for one offhand comment, saidquietly as he turned his head close to my ear. “So you got screwed,”he whispered. “Happens all the time in my business. Forget it.”Nothing more. Clooney really is as swell as everyone says he is.For my money, even more so. This guy is grounded, “for real,” as thecliché goes. I’ve seen him a number of times since. Always thesame. He wears Hollywood stardom more lightly than anyone I’ve ever known, and I’ve known my share. After he introduced me tothe audience, I received a standing ovation, which to me was greatlymoving.I was basking in the glow of this wonderful experience untilreality set in on the plane back to New York. Somewhere overColorado it hit me that I didn’t have a job. I was staring atunemployment. For the first time in more than four decades, I wouldnot have anyplace I had to be the next morning, and that thoughtwas unsettling. I was barely 30 when I started at CBS. Now, eventhough I was damned near 75 years old, retirement never crossedmy mind. I wasn’t built for rocking chairs; there was no questionthat I’d rather wear out than rust out.When I got home, a young60 Minutes producer named NeerajKhemlani inquired about how the West Coast trip and my time withGeorge Clooney had gone. Neeraj, whom I had not known very wellfor very long, had been helpful and understanding during my exile at60 Minutes. One of my few pleasant surprises while I was there washis support and encouragement. I found that to be in short supplyduring that difficult time, even from colleagues I had counted asfriends, but here was a guy I barely knew who recognized what atough situation I was in and was empathetic. Born in Queens andNew York to the core, Neeraj was then in his late 20s. Among hisother strengths, he knew all about high tech and the digital age.(Today, Neeraj Khemlani is an executive vice president at HearstEntertainment and Syndication, specializing in digital media. I amconfident that his career trajectory will continue upward.)Beyond being whip smart, however, he was also wise beyond hisyears about many aspects of life at CBS, including how I was beingsealed off—iced—at60 Minutes, and why. Quietly and discreetly headvised me that I needed to think outside the box about my future—outside the CBS box, that is. Although he admired my perseverancein my stated hope of surviving at CBS, Neeraj had always beensteadfastly skeptical about my chances. That said, his attempts tooffer me a reality check had been no more successful than anyoneelse’s. When I got back from Los Angeles, Neeraj asked me if someoneby the name of Jeffrey Skoll had been at the awards ceremony. Thename didn’t ring a bell. Skoll, he explained, invests in and producesdocumentary and public-service programming and is at least anacquaintance and maybe a friend of Clooney’s. I told him that hewas not present that evening, but that it was my recollection thatsomeone at the table had mentioned his name over dinner.“You should call Clooney and ask his advice,” Neeraj counseled,“and ask him about Skoll.”I took Neeraj’s advice and called George. I didn’t reach him butleft a message that I was seeking advice. Even though I didn’tmention Skoll in my message, Clooney’s reply was a suggestion thatJeff Skoll might be a good person for me to contact.To be honest, I’d never heard of Skoll before this sequence ofevents, but I was in great company—by his choice, he stays veryprivate. Skoll had been eBay’s first full-time employee and haddesigned its business plan—the road map that made it into anInternet powerhouse and a household word. He left the companywith a personal bank account of about $2 billion and a commitmentto philanthropy and social activism. Skoll went on to foundParticipant Media so that he could finance film projects that echo hisbeliefs. Participant Media had backed two Clooney hits,Good Night,and Good Luck andSyriana, as well asAn Inconvenient Truth,Charlie Wilson’s War,The Cove and many more.Skoll was gracious when I called him. He agreed that I couldcome see him in Los Angeles. I flew out from New York and went toa small building in an unpretentious neighborhood, where he has acomfortable but modest office. No tycoon trappings for this guy. As Idrew myself up to walk in, I took a deep breath and said to myself,“Well, this is a Hail Mary if there ever was one.” Inside, he put me atease right away. We talked for a while. He listened closely, thensuggested that I talk with Mark Cuban, owner of HDNet and theDallas Mavericks basketball team.Mark had made his first billion within a decade of graduating fromcollege. At the height of the dot-com boom, he took his firstcompany, Broadcast.com, public before selling it in 1999 to Yahoo! Six months later, he bought the Mavericks and proceeded totransform the unsuccessful franchise into a playoff-caliber team andthen into an NBA champion. Mark is famous—some might saynotorious—for his devotion to the Mavs. That devotion includesopenly criticizing referees who he believes have made bad callsagainst his players and calling out members of opposing teams whohe thinks have been rough or unfair. His outspokenness has costhim; the league has levied more than $1.7 million in fines againsthim. (On his own, he voluntarily matches each penalty, dollar fordollar, with a charitable donation.)A fixture at Mavericks home games, he often flies his Gulfstreamto away games as well. You almost always know when he’s inattendance, because he chooses to sit not in the skyboxes butamong the fans, and as close to courtside as possible. In 2001, helaunched HDNet, a TV station broadcasting exclusively in highdefinition format. Programming on the station covers a wide rangeof subjects, including adventure, travel, sports, music and news.I had never met Mark. All I knew of him was what I’d seenwatching Mavericks games, where, by his own description, he “letsthe boy in me out.” I did some quick homework about HDNetbecause I had barely heard of it and had never seen it before. Wemet at a Dallas seafood restaurant for lunch. He brought along hislongtime friend and partner, Todd Wagner.I was under the impression that this would be just a get-acquainted session. For the meeting, my job as I saw it was to putto rest the notion that I was a lightning rod for trouble. Given hishistory, perhaps I should have guessed that from Cuban’s point ofview, “lightning rod” was not derogatory. In fact, quite the opposite.“Ilike the fact that you are a lightning rod!” he told me. Barely threeminutes later, he asked, “What do you want to do?”I suddenly realized that this was a question I should have beenprepared for. I wasn’t. For a second or two I looked at him blankly,because I truly didn’t know what to say. I ad-libbed and suggestedthat I could do a Charlie Rose–style talk show. “We can do that,” hereplied, then added, “What is it going to cost?” I said I didn’t know. That was the wrong answer. “What else?” heasked.Ad-libbing again, I suggested, “I could get a morning showtogether, or a nightly news program.”“How much will those cost?” he asked again. Again, I had noidea.“I want you to come to work for me,” he declared. “Let’s dosomething great together.” Grabbing the nearest napkin, he said,“Here, I’ll write it on this!”I was appreciative—heaven knows, appreciative—butoverwhelmed. I offered the thought that perhaps we were getting abit ahead of ourselves. Mark didn’t listen. He didn’t even slow down.Once Mark Cuban makes a decision, roughly zero seconds elapsebefore he moves into implementation mode.“Get me a list of the things you think you can do,” he continued,“not necessarily in order of preference. Let’s get a deal and getgoing,” he said emphatically.I left feeling immensely encouraged. At the meeting, there hadbeen no mention of salary, which didn’t bother me in the slightest.What mattered was what had always mattered—the news. Here wasa prayer answered, a chance to get back into covering the news.Some people call Mark impatient; I do not. Mark doesn’t do smalltalk. Mark is intense, focused, decisive. To me, he’s just a man whoknows what he wants.As it turned out, what he wanted was me. As he later told JimRendon inMother Jones, “I thought news on TV sucked. It hadbecome so corporate and ratings-driven that there was nojournalism anymore. Dan Rather is a personal, guilty pleasure… Thatis the beauty of being an independent network. I program what Idamn please. I thought this was such a great opportunity, notbecause I wanted to do a Fox or MSNBC type of thing. It was theexact opposite: I want Dan Rather being Dan Rather.”I went home and banged out a long e-mail (only to learn laterthat Markhates long e-mails) that covered five ideas and a ballparkestimate of the cost of each (if the Astrodome is your ballpark). Ihad one more idea that I almost did not include, but I tacked it on at the last minute as No. 6 at the bottom. This idea was a way ofgetting back to what I loved the most—real investigative journalism.My No. 6 was my dream program—a combination of60 Minutes,Nightline and the classic Edward R. Murrow showSee It Now.I sent the e-mail to Mark Cuban at about 11:00 p.m. Easterntime. Within five minutes, he e-mailed me back saying, “I want No.6. That’s what I want to do.” And of course, he wanted to know howmuch it would cost. I had a rough idea of what a segment of60Minutes cost at CBS, so I put together a guesstimate and added thatI thought it would take me seven or eight months to get it on the air.Again, that was the wrong answer. I might as well have said eightyears. It was now summer of 2006, and Mark wanted me on his airon HDNet in the fall—and by fall, he meant September, or October atthe latest. “I am not sure that’s possible,” I told him over the phone.“Make it possible,” he replied simply. “Let’s get a contract done.How soon can you be in Dallas to work out the details?”I jumped on a plane immediately to go meet with Todd Wagner.Wagner runs HDNet Films; Cuban runs HDNet, but because Wagneris an attorney, he does some contracts for Mark. The two men havebeen close friends since college. Like Mark, Todd exudes intelligence.He has, however, a different personal and business style. Todd isquieter, less exuberant, more cautious and private. It’s a good fit—they complement each other. I found myself thinking, “It’s noaccident that these two guys have made billions together.”“Here’s what we’ll do,” Todd said as we sat down in Dallas. “We’llwork out a contract for each program, but we’ll figure out yourcompensation separately.” Working by phone with Phil Garvin, whoruns HDNet for Cuban from the network’s op-center in Denver, I haddone some reconnoitering in preparation for creating a budget forthe programs, but there were still a lot of variables. After Todd and Italked some and agreed on an approximate figure for the cost ofeach program, he dropped a conversational bombshell. “Mark wantsto do a program every week, all year long,” he said.My jaw dropped. “Dream on, maniac,” I said to myself. Only yearsof practice saved me from blurting out what I was thinking. I wascertain, however, that this was way too much to undertake, especially for the first year. I had just left60 Minutes, a long-running, well-established program. With a large staff, a big budgetand a major corporation behind it,60 Minutes does only about 26 to30 original hours a year. They have a heavy schedule of reruns. Wewere about to become a begin-from-scratch start-up with a newnetwork that was itself still a work in progress, and Mark wanted 52original hours a year.“Well,” I said as I swallowed hard and managed a smile, “Markobviously likes to dream big. So do I.”Todd and I settled on an initial contract with an estimated budgetto produce 42 programs annually for three years. Included in theagreement was some wiggle room so that production budgets couldvary from program to program. It wasn’t only that we anticipatedcost fluctuations depending on the needs of the story; we also hadto build in a learning curve for me to figure out how to do this.My new job was announced on July 11, 2006, when Mark Cubanand I faced the annual meeting of the Television Critics Associationat the Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena. “We’re thrilled that Dan is now partof HDNet,” Mark told them. “Now that he is finally released from theratings-driven and limited-depth confines of broadcast television, Iam excited about the impact Dan can have on the future of news.”From my perspective, that was about the best thing he couldhave said. Despite our differences in experience and workbackground, Mark Cuban and I share a compelling vision about theimportance of investigative journalism, both now and going forward.With his backing, my second act as a journalist began.“As a team player,” I promised, “I intend to give Mark and HDNetall of the hard work, loyalty and fearless, high-quality reportingpossible.” I meant it, but at the time we were still doing business ona handshake. When we had dinner together that evening, he toldme that the lawyers were almost done finalizing the contracts andreiterated that he wanted the first program on the air by October atthe latest. I told him I would try. It was a pleasant dinner, and itended with him saying, “Go do it!”“October at the latest… Mark’s words kept ringing in my ears.Without being sure I could do it, I signed the contract. We were off and running. The clock was ticking, and it already felt like I was waybehind.A few mornings later, I got up, read the paper, thought about theprospects and made some notes. The morning after that, I hadbegun to do the same thing when Jean asked me what I was doing.“I’m thinking,” I told her.Yet another wrong answer. Jean looked me squarely in the eye.There was no avoiding her lasers. “The man told you to go do it,”she said, “sooooo…go do it!”“I don’t know how,” I confessed.“Well, you need people, but before that you need office space,”she said. “Why don’t you call around to some friends who know alittle about commercial real estate and get their advice?”As it has been for more than half a century, Jean’s wise, wifelykick in the pants was just what I needed. After talking with friends, Ibegan looking for temporary quarters. I needed a beachhead tobegin working, and finding a permanent location would take time. Iwas also warned that my interim address would be really important,and that it needed to be in prime real estate, like on Park Avenue. Iput on my hat and walked from one building to the next on Park. Byluck, I stumbled on a building that specialized in short-term officespace. When I entered, the only person visible was a receptionist. Itold her who I was and what I was looking for.She looked at me skeptically, then pushed a button on herintercom. “Yeah, Harry. There’s a guy here at the front desk. Tellsme he’s Dan Rather,” she said, dripping cynicism with everyBrooklynesque syllable. “Says he wants to look at aww-fice space.”Harry appeared from nowhere and showed me a space thatlooked good, or at least good enough. I checked in with friends toverify that the price was fair, and within two days, I signed acontract. HDNet headquarters in Dallas was pleased at how fast Iwas moving, but when I bragged to Jean about it, she had just onequestion: “When do the phones come in?”Telephones? I hadn’t thought of telephones. That’s how naïve Iwas. The building took care of getting them, but Jean’s prodding question was a reminder that I couldn’t afford to be patting myselfon the back when I really hadn’t done anything yet.At about the same time, I ran into Suzanne MeirowitzNederlander on the street. Suzanne had been a colleague at CBS;she’d left the network to start a family, and we’d lost touch afterthat. As we caught up, I confessed to her that I was really strugglingto get things rolling. She walked back to the office with me, took onedisapproving look around and declared, “You need help.”It was true. I don’t have any natural instincts to run a business orto start one up—quite the opposite. I was approaching everythingpiecemeal, and I was overwhelmed by the process. Suzanne satdown at one corner of the metal desk—the only desk in the place—and started organizing things. She began with a list of people Ineeded to hire and went on from there. Finally, there was a gameplan.I needed an executive producer. Wayne Nelson came immediatelyto mind. Wayne is an experienced producer—been there, done that,at least twice. I had worked with him at CBS; we’d been in all kindsof tight corners together. War zones, hurricanes, political campaigns.The list is long. When I offered him a job, he was on board rightaway. Within a week, he had started working on program ideas.We then took on three new employees and got more phones, butit quickly became apparent that the office was just too small. Soonenough, it became ridiculous. We ran it like a Hong Kong hot-pillowjoint. The chairs were timeshares—“You get the seat for the first sixhours, but you’ll be sitting on the floor after lunch, because someoneelse needs it then.” People were elbow to elbow. With no place togo, our folks started spilling out into the hallway, and our overfloweventually became a problem for the other tenants. Suzanne finallyfound us permanent offices on 42nd Street, where we still are today.Once we moved into something we could call home, the chaosbegan to settle down.Meanwhile, of course, we hadn’t shot a single frame. When wedid start shooting footage, it was at a breakneck pace to meetMark’s deadline. Eventually I called Mark to tell him that we couldmake his October deadline, but only if all of us were squeezed dry by the end of it. He gave us a month’s dispensation. Our firstsegment was broadcast on November 14, 2006; entitled “ComingHome,” it dealt with soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.We proudly put it on the air; nevertheless, we all knew there wasnot another finished segment behind it in the can. We still had atremendous amount of work to do to get the next piece ready, andthe one after that, and the one after that…During that first year, I was the quintessential frequent flyer. Ispent most of my life airborne, traveling from one story to another,one producer to another. One week I was on the road in Alaska,then in Florida and finally in Colorado. Wayne ran the office when hewasn’t out in the field working with me. We had people coming andgoing, shooting stories, scripting stories, editing stories.Everything was a work in progress, including the staff. In additionto everything else, Wayne also supervised the hiring. “I want peoplewith a relentless work ethic and a driven pursuit of excellence,” I toldhim. Beyond that, however, we were also looking for monks, nunsand/or hermits. In the early going we needed people who in theshort term didn’t want/didn’t need a personal life—someone whohad retired, or who had no children. No one was going to get a lot offamily time that summer and fall. Including me. I’d come back to theoffice for a half day to talk to the people Wayne thought I shouldhire, then take off again.Looking back on that time, I marvel that we were able to getlaunched—I had not realized how much of a challenge it would be tobuild something new from a flat-footed start. I marvel even morethat we managed to keep going. Christmas break was the firstchance we had to catch our breath. By the time we got back inJanuary 2007, I thought we were rolling pretty good, only to find outthat other people in the business, people I respected, had decidedwe were barking mad.I spoke with two producers I’d known for years at CBS. Both ofthem thought we were crazy. “Your show will be off the air in four orfive months,” one told me, “because by then you will have simplyrun your people into the ground.” “Dan, this is insane,” the other chimed in. “You can’t possiblyproduce programs of this length and at the quality you demand inthis short a time.”In the words of George Bernard Shaw, “People who say it can’tbe done should not interrupt those who are doing it.” That firstseason we were nominated for two Emmys. My former boss BillSmall, who had been the stalwart Washington bureau chief allthrough Watergate, at the time chaired the News and DocumentaryCommittee for the Emmys. He didn’t pick the winners, but he let meknow that people viewing our segments had been telling him thatour stuff could run with anyone’s. That’s what I thought as well, butit was great to hear it from an outside source.We didn’t win that year, even though I believe we deserved to.More important, we’re still here… and it’s now five years andcounting since that manic debut season. Over that time, we’ve beennominated for 12 Emmys and won three—so far. Our latest Emmywas awarded in September 2011. For the second consecutive year,Dan Rather Reports won the Emmy for Outstanding Business andEconomic Reporting in a News Magazine. The honored segment was“The Mysterious Case of Kevin Xu,” produced by Kelly Buzby. KevinXu is a businessman who conspired with others from his nativeChina to traffic in counterfeit drugs. These were not just so-calledlifestyle enhancement drugs such as Cialis and Viagra, butprescription pharmaceuticals used to treat serious conditions,including schizophrenia, stroke and cancer. The sting operation thattook him down led to his arrest and conviction. He is currently inprison.Mark Cuban was enthusiastic about the award. “What more can Isay aboutDan Rather Reports?” he exclaimed. “Week after weekthey cover in-depth stories with excellence, and the industrydefinitely takes notice. Two years in a row for this category is anamazing honor.”We try to pursue the stories no one else is covering, includingcomplex stories that really need the hour we can give them. Some ofthe most impactful are discussed below. “Lloyds TSB: Money Launderers for Iran”One of the first stories I broke on HDNet concerned the bank LloydsTSB, which has its roots in the United Kingdom. (Please note thatLloyds TSB is not to be confused in any way with the more well-known Lloyd’s of London, the famed insurer of such celebrity bodyparts as Tina Turner’s legs, Bruce Springsteen’s vocal cords, and soon.) Lloyds TSB is a banking operation, and in the wake of the attackon the World Trade Center, it was involved in money laundering thatfacilitated Iran’s ability to procure nuclear weapons and otherdangerous materials.On the black market, dollars are the only acceptable currency.Lloyds TSB would send perhaps $50 million in Iranian scrip to NewYork; it would be returned as dollars, with the understanding that noone would reveal where the money came from. Other banks havesubsequently been identified as providing similar laundering services,but Lloyds TSB is probably the biggest.Before Robert Morgenthau retired as Manhattan district attorney,he spoke to us about the money-laundering scheme that he haddiscovered. “Going back to 9/11… New York is always going to be aprime target for terrorists. We’ve got to be on the alert here andmake sure we’re doing whatever it takes to make it difficult.”Morgenthau discovered a building on Fifth Avenue that wasowned by Bank Melli, Iran’s largest bank. More significantly, it isIran’snational bank; in other words, it is government owned. Forabout 12 years, the Iranians ran billions of dollars through Bank Melliand other financial institutions in order to have the currency topurchase weapons-grade nuclear materials on the black market. AndLloyds TSB was one of the biggest money launderers—much to theembarrassment of Britain’s Parliament.But the trail of money really leads to Dubai, where I talked withJohn Cassara, former CIA officer and Treasury investigator. “Thereare approximately 7,000 to 8,000 Iranian businesses in Dubai,”Cassara told me. “Many of them are the proverbial import-exportconcerns or freight forwarding concerns. A lot of them, quite candidly, are front companies set up by the Iranian government inorder to procure prohibited goods and technologies. And they arequite effective.”The production team on this segment included Wayne Nelson,executive producer, Elliot Kirschner, senior producer, and AndrewGlazer, producer. It won an Emmy—our first in this category atDanRather Reports—for Outstanding Business and Economic Reporting.“Pornland, Oregon”The most downloaded episode to date ofDan Rather Reports is astory that first caught producer Kim Balin’s attention in an editorialshe read in theOregonian. The editorial dealt with sex trafficking inthe state and included daunting statistics on the number ofunderage girls who were trapped in illegal prostitution rings. Kimwas especially surprised by the prevalence of Caucasian middle-classgirls who were involved in a supposedly clean, wholesome town likePortland.Portland—City of Roses, bicycles, microbreweries, running shoes…We tend to think well of Portland. The idea that there might bewidespread sex trafficking in children in this eco-friendly city seemedimpossible, but our investigation confirmed what the editorial hadfound, and then some. We discovered 80-year-old men paying apremium to violate teenage girls. The girls were supplied by formerdrug gangs, who were getting into the business of child sextrafficking because it was so lucrative.Balin was joined by producer Sianne Garlick and editor LauraMinnear in following the story of an 11-year-old girl who wasmanipulated by an older man pretending to be her boyfriend. Hetook her to dinner, showered her with presents and treated her likehis true love. Meanwhile, he drove a wedge between the girl and herfamily, after which she left home and moved in with him. At hisrequest, she had sex with his friends and then entered the violentlife of full-time prostitution. Ernie Allen, CEO of the National Center for Missing and ExploitedChildren, estimates that there are 100,000 to 300,000 girls—children—who are sexually exploited each year. A nationwide FBI stingoperation netted the arrest of 99 pimps and the recovery of 69underage prostitutes. The highest concentration of childrenrecovered was in the Pacific Northwest. Portland remains one of theworst cities (it has more strip clubs than Las Vegas), but until thisepisode ofDan Rather Reports, there were only two officersassigned to the city’s human trafficking detail. Now there are four—still not enough. The problem, however, now has a much higherprofile in the city, which recently set up homeless shelters with bedsspecifically earmarked for victims of underage prostitution.This episode won the Ida B. Wells Award for Bravery inJournalism.“Plastic Planes”On September 18, 2007,Dan Rather Reports took on Boeing, thebiggest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, just as it wasabout to debut its new 787 Dreamliner, which has an innovativefuselage composed largely of plastic. Boeing had staked its financialfuture on the Dreamliner, and it looked like the bet was about to payoff. The lightweight twin-engine plane has a range of more than8,000 miles, enough to fly passengers nonstop from New York toTokyo. Despite a price of $185 million or more per aircraft, theorders were stacking up.But there were allegations of significant problems, problems thatthe manufacturer was trying hard to ignore. We made contact withVince Weldon, a loyal Boeing employee who had worked there for 46years. Weldon had a sterling reputation within the company, havingworked on the revolutionary wing design of the 727, the spaceshuttle orbiter and studies for NASA and the Air Force. Because ofhis strong background in composites, Weldon had been asked byBoeing to research the ways these lightweight materials could beused in the next generations of civilian and military aircraft. Weldon knew all about the attributes of CFRP, or carbon fiberreinforced plastic. Because it is both lighter and stronger than thealuminum now used in aircraft fuselages, it would have decisivecost-per-mile advantages. While the Dreamliner was still indevelopment, Boeing trumpeted the news that it would save theairlines 3 billion gallons of fuel over 20 years. Since the compositeswould have better fatigue resistance and less corrosion thanaluminum, they also offered the possibility of a longer productive lifefor each aircraft.Weldon is a conscientious engineer who believed that theseeconomic advantages were offset by serious problems—safety issuesthat were being deliberately played down by company executivesdetermined to rush the Dreamliner into service. Boeing’s fast-trackschedule called for just six months of flight testing, culminating infederal certification and aircraft delivery by May 2008.Weldon was not alone; many other senior aerospace engineers atBoeing had reservations about the Dreamliner as well. All of theothers, however, feared for their jobs if they went public. Theyneeded a spokesman, a highly respected Boeing employee nearingretirement. Weldon stepped forward.It soon became apparent that the job security fears of Weldon’scolleagues were well founded. Weldon’s supervisor did not react wellwhen Weldon confronted him with his analysis of the safety issues ofthe 787. “You’re dangerous,” he told Weldon, “and you need to findanother job.” After Weldon contacted the FAA to express hisconcerns, he was quickly fired. He consequently applied forwhistleblower status with the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA) but was denied.The issues Weldon and the other engineers pointed out wereserious and could have greatly affected the crashworthiness of theDreamliner. The first is that composite is brittle. It breaks, asopposed to aluminum, which bends. This translates into a lack oftoughness or resilience, in particular the inability to absorb shock onimpact in the event of a crash landing. Weldon also pointed out thatthe smoke from burning composites is so toxic that the FAA hadalready banned its use inside aircraft that are currently in service. We found these concerns and others to be credible, and we weretroubled by Boeing’s cavalier denial that any problems existed.Beyond that, we were alarmed by the FAA’s lack of response toWeldon and by their cozy relationship to the aerospace industry,especially to Boeing. Marion Blakey, who is the president and chiefexecutive officer of the Aerospace Industries Association, is also thetop lobbyist for the AIA, of which Boeing is the largest member. Evenmore worrisome was that two of the top FAA officials in charge ofcertifying the 787 had ties to Boeing.Our report shed light on what might otherwise have been sweptunder the rug. It triggered a reassessment of the certificationprocess and caused Boeing to reluctantly acknowledge potentialproblems with the CFRP fuselage. In the aftermath, Boeing delayeddelivery—seven times. Aircraft industry wags starting calling theDreamliner the “7-Late-7.” The first 787s were delivered to ANA inJapan and were added to their operating fleet in the fall of 2011.These were better, safer airliners because Boeing had finally takenmore time before delivery.This segment, produced by Margaret Ebrahim, was nominated foran Emmy for Outstanding Investigative Reporting of a BusinessNews Story.“Spiritually Bankrupt”This 2010 episode ofDan Rather Reports dealt with the response ofthe Catholic Church to the many cases of abuse by priests. Initially Ihad very mixed feelings about this segment, because I have greatrespect for the church and its charitable work all over the globe. Inthis report, however, we discovered that many Catholic dioceses inthe United States are using bankruptcy as a shield to evade payingthe victims of their priests.There is a quotation from Theodore Roosevelt that graces thewebsite of the California law firm of Manly & Stewart: “Aggressivefighting for the right is the noblest sport the world affords.” AttorneyJohn Manly has represented hundreds of clergy abuse victims over the past 15 years and is at the epicenter of the fight to winjudgments against the dioceses. He has been involved in litigationagainst the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, as well as the Dioceses ofSan Diego, San Bernardino, Monterey, Stockton, Sacramento, Juneauand Fairbanks.A self-described “good Catholic,” Manly is shocked by the way hischurch has conducted itself in the proceedings. “They operate in away you would expect Bernard Madoff to operate, not how youwould expect Christ to operate,” he says. “When the church defendsthese cases, they don’t defend it in a way that is consistent withtheir own theology and beliefs. They defend it in a way where thevictim is under attack, the family is under attack. All of the valuesthey say they believe in really go out the window.”Manly’s Newport Beach offices are less than an hour north of theheadquarters of the Diocese of San Diego, which has about ahundred parishes and one of the worst records in the country forclergy sexual abuse. After the scandals first came to light, the courtswere deluged with lawsuits by victims who, in Manly’s words, “hadbeen too afraid, too ashamed, or discouraged by church officials tospeak up as children.”In the aftermath, San Diego became the fifth diocese in theUnited States to file for bankruptcy protection. According to Manly,the San Diego diocese had about 160 claims, and he was astonishedby the way the church dealt with the victims. The diocese firstchallenged the waiver of the statute of limitations and then deposedthe victims. Immediately before the first trial was to begin, thediocese declared bankruptcy, which moved the proceedings intofederal court.“At the first hearing,” Manly recalls, “it became very clear thatthey were minimizing their assets. The diocese owned several billiondollars’ worth of real property, but they listed it in the bankruptcyschedules as being worth book value. In other words, theypretended that it was worth what they paid for it. Well, the diocesehas been around since the 1800s, so there were buildings worth $5million that they listed for $150,000, which is what they had paid forit originally.” As our researchers discovered, however, this was just thebeginning. There were millions of dollars’ worth of church propertiesthat were simply missing from the official list of assets that thediocese had provided, including open land, parking lots andcommercial buildings. One $65 million property in particularattracted the interest of Don McLean, who was interviewed for theprogram. He was serving on the creditors’ committee, a groupappointed by the court to keep those filing for bankruptcy honest intheir claims. He had also been a ten-year-old altar boy when twopriests molested him. “My major motivation was to get justice forthat ten-year-old child inside of me. It was not about the money.Your childhood is stolen and part of you is gone. You can’t replacethat with money.”It would appear that the church is clamping down on the abilityof victims like McLean to find closure. More and more dioceses areplaying a shell game, hiding assets and moving money that could beused to reimburse survivors. They are seeking protection under theVatican and under the international scope of the Roman CatholicChurch—and they are finding it.Some zealous defenders of the church have taken the positionthat lawsuits on behalf of clerical abuse victims are an excuse todestroy the Catholic Church on a worldwide basis. John Manlyresponds, “The problem with that argument is that this is not whatthey preach. I was taught differently as I was growing up in thechurch—and I had some very good priests as teachers. The churchis not a building. It’s not the Vatican. It’s not a gold chalice. It is notan expensive piece of art. It is the faith. Nobody I know wants to killthe Catholic Church. Certainly, I do not. But there is an unwillingnessand an arrogance to their defense. They are really not worried aboutthe Church surviving. What they are worried about is protecting thehierarchical and patriarchal system that has imposed horrible evil onchildren. That’s what they are trying to protect. And the pope hasdirect responsibility for this. He has been in charge for 25 years andis supposed to monitor priests. And he did not do a damn thing toprotect kids. And that’s a shame.” Produced by Andrew Glazer and coproduced by Steve Tyler,“Spiritually Bankrupt” earned an Emmy nomination for OutstandingInvestigative Journalism in a News Magazine.Lightning rod indeed. As these summaries amply demonstrate, wehave taken on some very big and very controversial topics.Nevertheless, there has been no corporate hovering or meddling.When Mark asked me to join HDNet, he told me he’d give mecomplete creative and editorial control. Not only that, he put it inwriting—it’s in my contract. At first, I was worried that I didn’t havemuch contact with him, but I have come to understand that if I don’thear from him, that’s a good thing. I used to e-mail status reports tohim once or twice a week; in general I got a response within twominutes, sometimes within half a minute. It was later brought to myattention that I shouldn’t contact him unless there was something Iwas asking him to act upon, and then I should keep it short.Anything over a sentence or two is excessive.One of the few times Mark initiated a phone call to me was whenwe did the Dreamliner segment. Not surprisingly, our story madeBoeing very unhappy, and their response was to smear VinceWeldon, our source. They also contacted Mark and tried to applypressure from above.Big mistake.“Investigative journalism means uncovering stuff that people aretrying to keep hidden,” I told him when he called. “Of course thatmakes them angry. Hard news needs owners who are willing to takethe pressure and not back down.”“Got your back,” he told me. Mark was a tiger on our behalf. Inperson, in print and on the Internet, he defended us vigorously, sovigorously I thought for a while that I was one of his DallasMavericks—which in some ways I suppose I am. He did so not justthen, but whenever necessary thereafter. His staunch support standsin sharp contrast to the spineless, risk-averse management climatethat prevailed at CBS since the network became a relatively smallcog in a larger conglomerate. I like to think we are doing Murrow’s work, even though he had abigger staff and a much larger organization. Today there are 22people who work full-time forDan Rather Reports, and I’ve hiredevery one of them. They have regular salaries, health care andbenefits. We also have another dozen freelancers who work with uson a fairly regular basis.I am the leader of this very small but mighty band of investigativejournalists. I believe in the ten magic words: “If it is to be, it is up tome.” We sink or swim based on the choices I make. The buck stopshere and there is no safety net.Executive producer Wayne Nelson is Captain Can-Do. He is acomplete pro, and the relationship we have is one of complete andtotal trust. In addition to being willing and able to do whatever isrequired, he has a rare and valuable gift. Wayne has a tremendoussense of perspective, an ability to see the program as an entity, notjust as the sum of its parts.Elliot Kirschner is our senior producer. Like Wayne, Elliot has animpressive ability to visualize the entire hour of the broadcast.Acknowledged as one of the best young talents at CBS News, Elliotleft a promising career there to come join us, and I was astonishedto the point of amazement when he agreed to come aboard. He tooka real chance, and I feel so fortunate to have him.Wayne, Elliot and I constitute the command structure, as it were,supervising the work of our producers and of the rest of our staff.“Producer” is a term borrowed from the film business—in Hollywood,Jeffrey Skoll is a producer. In the news business, “producer” meanssomething very different. Old school as I am, I tend to think of ourproducers as reporters. Most of the time I call them reporter-producers, and I don’t think they mind. These people are my boots-on-the-ground journalists—my story hunters, story breakers andstorytellers.They are an extraordinarily dedicated group. Each of them choseus as much as we chose them, and every one of them has abackstory. Andrew Glazer, for example, is an experienced journalistwho had been with the Associated Press for several years. When heheard about what we were doing, he called and said he wanted a job. We had an opening, but the fact that he was based in LosAngeles was a problem. Because we had no money to move himacross the country, I initially turned him down.He called back and said, “What if I move myself?” I was temptedbut cautious. “Give me six months,” he pleaded. “I’m sick of coveringKardashians. Who knew there were so many of them?” Andrew hada great passion for the work but no television experience.Somewhere in the back of my brain, a bell rang faintly. Manyyears ago, someone had taken a chance on me when I had greatpassion but no television experience. With Cal Jones nodding hisapproval from on high, I offered Andrew the job and have neverregretted it. We mentored and tutored Andrew about working intelevision, and he has become a fine investigative journalist.Our staff is mostly young. I take the mentoring responsibility veryseriously, even as it gives me great joy. I teach, but I am also taughtby our younger people, who can use a computer in ways that makemy head whirl. I struggle to keep up. What I give them in return is aperspective based on a lifetime in the news. We talk about sources.We talk frequently about how to do interviews. I think I’m a prettygood interviewer—I ought to be at this stage of the game.Rather’s Rules for Interviews• Preparation is the key. The more you prepare, the better chanceyou have for a good interview.• Listening is almost as important. Listen actively. Many timesyour best questions come from picking up on something theinterview subject has said. Don’t be a prisoner of your notebook,going down your list of questions.• Prioritize your questions. I usually separate the interview intothree parts: the key group of four to six questions that I must ask;another group of the same size that are secondary but nonethelessimportant; and a third set to ask if we get that far. • Pay attention to nonverbal cues. Is someone avoiding eyecontact, or fidgeting, or wringing their hands? How a response isgiven, as well as the subject’s facial expression or body language,can be very telling.• Understand the power of pauses. After asking a question, don’tpop back with another one right on the heels of the initial response.The dead air may seem interminable, but you can always edit thatout. On the other hand, I’ve heard a lot of interesting things thatwere blurted out by folks who got squirrelly in the silence.I’m proud of what we’ve done here. We are doing good work, andit’s getting better. I firmly believe that we are just about the bestplace to be for young investigative journalists. And I shouldemphasize that investigative journalists are becoming an endangeredspecies, just when we need more of them than ever before. All of ushere are living proof that reinvention and adaptability are alive andwell—that it is more than possible to apply solid journalisticprinciples to new media, breaking stories even in a challengingeconomic environment.When we first started, finding somebody who had seen theprogram was harder than finding an ivory-billed woodpecker. Wenow have more than 23 million subscribers. Our audience still maynot match that of the networks—not yet, at least—but it’s growing.And we are breaking stories that get picked up by other newsorganizations, including the major networks. At the networks, thechoice of which news gets presented each night is increasingly madefrom the top down, not by journalists, but by executives. There areexceptions but in general that’s the way it is now. Here our storiesbegin the old-fashioned way, with reporters who call in to tell usthey’re on to something. The news begins from the bottom up, withjournalists who are out in the field.And yes, we are still turning out 42 hour-long segments annually.How do I handle it? Mark Cuban taught me how by leading byexample. Hire good people, then stand back and let them do theirjob—which is exactly how he treats me. I’ve hired a remarkable staff, and I know each of them personally. I care about them andknow they care about me. More important, we all care about themission. We depend on one another to get the job done. Working atHDNet is literally a whole new world to me, a world I could not haveimagined in my darkest days at the end of my tenure—and my rope—at CBS.Cuban. Skoll. Clooney. These men renewed and extended mycareer far beyond what I ever imagined when I left CBS, and at alevel far above what I hoped was possible. When I left, I wasthinking small. I dreamed of doing a few documentaries, or maybebeing head of the journalism department at a prestigious university.I am so grateful that these three guys came out of nowhere tolaunch me on a whole new career. That old phrase “the kindness ofstrangers” comes to mind. I confess that I’ve learned so much fromeach of them, which may surprise them. It surprised me as well. Asyou age and as you build experience, you tend to be less and lessinclined to believe that you can learn—and learn big—from youngerpeople. And the more you age, the truer it becomes—this is wherethat other old phrase, “set in his ways,” comes in.My interaction with these three remarkable men has been agenuine eye-opener and mind expander, not to mention a humblingexperience. We so easily become complacent; it’s just humannature. They have taught me that you have to fight to keep yourmind open to new ideas and new ways of doing things, and that thefight to do that is never-ending. To stay sharp, boldness, creativityand determination are required. This is how they live their own lives.By their example, they have taught me the difference betweenbeing privileged and being entitled. They take nothing for granted.To keep accomplishing, they know they have to work hard and keepstriving. Although I’ve long carried that knowledge somewhere deepinside myself, they have prodded me to pull it up, place it front andcenter and put it into sharp focus.None of them has to work. Each of these men has more thanenough money to spend all his time sailing on the Aegean Sea orlazing around the south of France. None of them does that. Instead,their money, and the privilege that money has earned, fuels them to scale ever-greater heights. Not for more money, but to accomplishmeaningful and important things.When many people reach this level of accomplishment, theythrottle back. These three use the opportunity to go full throttleforward, in many cases out into the vast unknown.And they like it out there.Cuban may not evenhave a throttle. If he does, I’ve never seenit. Mark is exuberant and intense and very public. Jeff Skoll is theopposite. Quiet and laid back, he works under the proverbial radar.George Clooney is some of each. All three share a desire to maketheir prosperity count for something, in effect to pay it forward. Theyare passionate about the causes they support.For Clooney, this involves walking a particularly treacheroustightrope. He leverages not just his bank account but his celebrity insupport of worthy causes. As a high-visibility public figure, hemanages to use his fame to call attention to world issues withoutgetting eaten alive in the process.All three are extremely bright. I’ve spent a lifetime interviewingand interfacing with smart people, people a helluva lot smarter thanI am, and these men are highly intelligent in the same particularkind of way. Each wants to break new ground, to do things that havenever been done before. And they don’t care much about what otherpeople think, because they are secure in their own passion for whatthey want their lives to be.This is especially true of Mark Cuban. More than anyone I’ve everknown, he really does not give a damn what other people think.Mark and I click. From my standpoint, it was that way right from thestart. I’m not sure exactly why, but the thought frequently occurs tome that, although we grew up in far different times and places, andalthough we are well apart in age, there are certain similarities inour backstories. Like me, Mark was not born with a silver spoon. Hisfather was an automobile upholsterer in Pittsburgh, and I am theson of a Texas ditchdigger and oilfield worker. Neither of us has anIvy League pedigree. Both of us burn to accomplish, to live a life ofmeaning, a life that counts for something. Different eras, differentpaths, but kindred memories of scratching and fighting for every inch of accomplishment. The same understanding that nobody wasgoing to hand you success, the same hope that empathetic strangerswould give you a hand along the way.Both of us grew up believing not just in thevalue of hard work,but in theimperative of hard work. With that as a preface, I amcontinually impressed with how hard Mark works. It isn’t just that heputs in long hours. This guy is all-in, all-out, every day. Mark Cubanidles in overdrive.Perhaps most important, Cuban and I share a common belief thatAmericans are not getting the news they need and deserve. Not by along shot. This strong conviction is what has fueled our success withDan Rather Reports. It is our shared passion and shared willingnessto put it all on the line to make it happen.I think I am now doing some of the best, most consistent workthat I’ve ever done. AtDan Rather Reports we are building the bodyof excellent work I’d envisioned wistfully when I was sitting alone inmy CBS office in the twilight of my time there. At the time, I feared Imight never get the chance, but here I am at age 80, doing the kindof reporting that I’ve dreamed about since I was a boy—a one-hourprogram each week, 42 weeks a year, of real news, hard news withan emphasis on investigative reporting. There has never been aperiod where I have felt happier and more satisfied and morefulfilled in the work I’m doing. My learning curve is still going up—waaaay up. I am learning about budgets and about other managerialresponsibilities; I am mentoring a handpicked young (mostly) staffwho shares my commitment to investigative reporting. I feed offtheir enthusiasm, and they key off me in return. I feel a very strongsense of responsibility to all of them. I work hard to be worthy oftheir respect. More than any other place I’ve ever been, I can’t comein here any day with less than my best game.I have this eagerness to get on the story and stick with it and diginto it. It is sheer joy for me. Part of it is the opportunity to do whatI want to do and to follow my own instincts about what’s news andwhat isn’t. To be completely, totally responsible for the result ofthose decisions is fresh and invigorating. This is what I got intojournalism to do. Being on HDNet is so different from being at CBS. I am constantlyscrambling on a high wire, with literally no net. There are many,many days when it’s like trying to change a fan belt on a movingMercedes. I wear a lot of hats, and sometimes it looks like we’ve allescaped from an episode ofSaturday Night Live. AtDan RatherReports, it is just me and my small team against the world. Iunderstand that we are unlikely to have as much impact as a largenetwork news organization. The audience is far smaller. Fewerpeople are going to know what we are doing. But we know.I know.And I judge success or failure by my own standards, not bysomebody else’s.This is a venture-capital-funded business model for delivering thenews. Unlike corporate network news, which is profit driven andshareholder driven, it is borderline philanthropic. Moving forward, Ibelieve there should be a bigger place for this kind of newsorganization.I also think there inevitably will be. I’m optimistic enough tobelieve that in the future, there may be CEOs of large corporations,companies with a news component, who will once again see a newsnetwork as a public trust and delivery of the news as a publicservice. They will value high-quality news as a significant companyasset that doesn’t show up on a balance sheet. Till that day comes,my association with Mark Cuban is as close to an ideal model as Icould have imagined.For me personally, the sense of freedom and exhilaration andaccomplishment I get from coming to work every day isunimaginable. This continues to be such an education and a growthexperience, and it’s unquestionably affected my mental and physicalhealth for the better. Professionally, I’ve never been happier, and I’llkeep working as long as I have my health, God’s grace and Mark’ssupport.After I’d been working with him for a couple of years, I had ameeting with Mark to review where we were and where we wantedto go. As meetings always are with Mark, this one was brief. “Thankyou for giving me this opportunity,” I said as I was leaving. “Thank you for allowing me to do what I deeply want to do. You’ve given meso much, what can I do for you?”Mark Cuban drilled me in the eyes and said, “Go piss people off.” EPILOGUECorporatization, Politicization andTrivialization of the NewsI have written before about my adventures as a journalist. This bookhas built on those stories, but in writing this time, I became moreaware than ever of the systemic changes to American freedom anddemocracy that have taken place during the past couple of decades.Powerful forces have overtaken America; we as individual citizensmust try to understand and contend with them.Much of my career has been dedicated to what we call“investigative reporting.” In general, I find that phrase to beredundant: Any worthwhile reporting needs to be, on at least somelevel, investigative. It has been my greatest journalistic love from thebeginning, and my passion for it has never left me. Although I’dwanted to be a reporter even as a child, I was in college when asingle experience galvanized that dream into what I realized was mylife’s purpose. When I was all of 20 years old, I was the one-manband—the reporter, DJ, sportscaster and also the janitor—at KSAM,the low-wattage local radio station near Sam Houston State TeachersCollege in Huntsville, Texas.It paid very little, but it was my first paying job in journalism. Ireported the story of a fatal house fire in the African-American partof town. Several people had been trapped inside and lost their lives.At first, the deaths were ruled accidental. Then I received ananonymous tip at the radio station. A man phoned in to say that if Ichecked around a bit, I would find that it was a case of arson. I followed that lead and soon learned that at least one of the charredbodies had bullets in it. That made it murder.In the beginning, I had only a piece of the story. When I soughtto report what I had, the good and decent man who ran KSAM wasalarmed. “A lot of powerful people are not going to like what you’vefound out, Dan,” he warned. “And they’re not gonna likeyou forhaving found it out. And if you report it, they will hate you.”This was startling stuff to hear at the age of 20, and to tell thetruth I sort of looked at the floor and ran my hands around the brimof my hat as I listened. I loved and respected this man, and he hadbeen terrific to me. To his everlasting credit, he never told me not torun the story. When I told him I felt we should report what we had,however, he went out of town for a few days. He left me alone todeal with the radio station, with my story and with its consequences.Running KSAM single-handed was the easy part. The challenge wasdealing with the folks with the pitchforks. What he had told meabout people not liking me, and worse, because of what I hadreported was all too accurate. Not only did I have to answer somenasty phone calls, I also received visits from some angry townsfolkwho showed up at the station—in person.I’m not the hero of this story. Others, including some very goodlaw-enforcement people, eventually broke the case open, revealingall of its horrid details. It turned out that a white man, a powerfuland influential person in Huntsville, had shot the people in the houseand set the fire to cover his crimes.This was the experience that got me hooked on investigativejournalism. I discovered that I had a passion for getting to the truth,or as close to the truth as I could get. In this case, mine was but asmall, peripheral contribution, launched by an anonymous tip.Nevertheless, I followed up and helped move the investigationalong. It was a powerful learning experience, one that I’ve carriedwith me ever since.Among the things I learned was how hard it can be to dig outthings that people, especially powerful people, don’t want the publicto know—things that more often than not turn out to be things thatyour fellow citizensneed to know. I also learned that my boss’s warning was prophetic, not just for me in that situation, but for thefuture as well. When you do this kind of reporting, not everybody isgoing to love you or respect you for it. Do a good job and report thetruth, and you’re probably going to catch hell. The challenge is beingwilling to do it anyway.The people with the pitchforks are still out there—those who aremad because a story is too inflammatory, or too controversial, orbecause it makes important people look bad. The catching hell parthas happened to me many times over the years—during the civilrights movement, during the Vietnam War, covering Watergate andyes, reporting on Abu Ghraib and on President George W. Bush’sfailure to fulfill his military service obligations. This is where the gutcheck comes in—you have to ask yourself whether you are willing toaccept the tumultuous aftermath that inevitably follows breaking anexplosive story—and whether those above you are willing to supportyou as well. Sometimes you get backstopped by people of integrity—the Paleys and Salants of the world—and sometimes you get hungout to dry by the Redstones and the Moonveses.I’ve told any number of young people this story, because it standsas a warning: Be careful when you start a career as an investigativereporter, because if you really get into it, it will become a passion.That’s a good thing: Today more than ever, the United States needsjournalists passionately committed to investigative reporting. A freepress is one of the cornerstones of democracy—a press willing toreport the stories that make powerful people angry.Today, however, our free press—and with it the idea of aninformed electorate—is in peril. The ascent of large multinationalcorporations has affected every aspect of American life. This includesthe gathering and dissemination of news, particularly broadcastnews. The networks have grown to be part of ever largerconglomerates. We’ve reached the point where six or fewer giantcorporations control 80 percent or more of the true nationaldistribution of news.News has become big business, and much of it is owned byconglomerates. In the 1960s CBS owned only six television stations.Now the major networks each have more than 40. And they are seeking to have more than 60. The consolidation of media power inthe hands of a few has contributed greatly to the change in ourculture. There were more than 50 newspapers, TV stations or radiostations that were either national or superregional as recently as thelate 1950s. In the 1960s it was 40. Now we are down to six or fewer.Media conglomerates want things out of Washington, and throughtheir campaign contributions and lobbying efforts they usually getthem. These huge enterprises, in which news becomes only a smallportion of what they do, have extensive legislative and regulatoryagendas in Washington.Those agendas are very much threatened when investigativejournalists uncover stories that are embarrassing—or worse—tolawmakers. The corporatization, politicization and trivialization of thenews has inhibited the ability of the news to function as part of oursystem of checks and balances, as had been envisioned by theFounding Fathers. Even when reporters break important stories,there can be powerful forces at work to suppress them, or waterthem down, as was the case at CBS with Abu Ghraib. Too often, thetop priority for large media companies is not the news, but theimperative to protect the interests of their parent companies andtheir advertisers. Burying or soft-pedaling a story is simplycensorship masquerading as good business.Media conglomerates also have a corporate mandate to increaseshareholder value. Those objectives have colored and at timesoverridden journalistic choices about what news gets reported andhow it is presented. When breaking news happens, regularprogramming is suspended—regular programming that is supportedby advertising, and therefore makes money. This is not a newproblem. Fred Friendly quit CBS in 1966 when the network opted torun old Lucille Ball comedies in preference to airing Senate hearingson the war in Vietnam.The profit imperative also means that news has become conflatedwith entertainment. News is no longer what it was when I started: apublic service. Today, few people talk about broadcast news in anyother way than as a ratings getter and profit center. And as anetwork profit center, there is now every expectation that network news divisions will generate ratings and hence revenue, just like anydrama or sitcom or sporting event—which is why the pope took abackseat to a tennis match, and why we now have four talkingheads in a studio shouting at one another, instead of four overseasbureaus covering real news.The contemporary picture is at least as grim in black and white asit is on television. Traditionally, newspapers have been the sources ofhard news, but today they are thinner than they have ever been.Most of them have not been able to pull out of the economic deathspiral of print media, nor have they been able to figure out how toreinvent themselves to make a profit online. In the quest forprofitability, both newspapers and TV news outlets have participatedin the corporatization of the news, the politicization of the news andthe trivialization of the news. The once indelible line betweeneditorial content and commercial content has become blurred and insome cases downright obliterated. Some newspapers have eventurned to focus groups—asking citizens what news theythink shouldbe covered, as opposed to informing them what theyneed to know.When the front page is full of one piece of bad news after another,we shouldn’t be surprised when focus groups ask for more stories onsports, or celebrities, or dog weddings.Chris Hedges has written a riveting essay on the subject. Entitled“Gone with the Papers,” he highlights what is at stake:We are losing a peculiar culture and an ethic. This loss isimpoverishing our civil discourse and leaving us less and lessconnected to the city, the nation, and the world around us.The death of newsprint represents the end of an era. Andnews gathering will not be replaced by the Internet.Journalism, at least on the large scale of old newsrooms, is nolonger commercially viable. Reporting is time-consuming andlabor-intensive. It requires going out and talking to people. Itmeans doing this every day. It means looking constantly forsources, tips, leads, documents, informants, whistleblowers,new facts and information, untold stories and news. Reporters often spend days finding little or nothing of significance. Thework can be tedious and is expensive…The steady decline of the news business means we areplunging larger and larger parts of our society into dark holesand opening up greater opportunities for uncheckedcorruption, disinformation and the abuse of power… Ademocracy survives when its citizens have access totrustworthy and impartial sources of information, when it candiscern lies from truth, and when civic discourse is grounded inverifiable fact.The question becomes what to do about it—how to preserve whatAlex S. Jones has called the Iron Core of News. In his excellent bookLosing the News, Jones talks about the Iron Core as baselinejournalism, exactly the kind of reporting that Chris Hedges wastalking about, where someone actually goes out in the field, gathersthe facts and reports the story. Jones also calls it “accountabilitynews” because its function is to hold the powerful accountable—bothin government and in daily life.Too many folks get their news from TV and online sources thathave become greatly distanced from the Core. These news outletsmerely aggregate and repackage news from other sources, which ishow some of them end up quoting one another or repeating thesame inaccurate information. And, of course, there are some whoexploit this echo chamber—those who cloak innuendo and falsehoodin the guise of news by blowing stories out of proportion, or byinventing them out of whole cloth and then repeating themendlessly. In their hands, a devoutly held falsehood becomes apowerful political weapon, the modern-day descendant of Hitler’s BigLie.For this and so many other reasons, more than ever we needunbiased reporters illuminating dark corners, whether far away ininternational conflicts or close to home in corruption-riddled stategovernments. In city after city, nobody is covering local government.There isn’t nearly enough coverage of state legislatures. Thewatchdog role of the press has evaporated. This is a topic of majorimportance. We have to prevent the Core from shrinking any further and get it to the point where it can expand again with reporters inthe field.Oddly enough, one of the few glimmers of hope in this regard isat CBS News. After I was forced out, much changed there, and atfirst it was not for the better. Les Moonves, an entertainment guy,installed his protégé Sean McManus as News Div president.McManus, a sports guy, set about vigorously implementingMoonves’s decision to break with the past. No more Murrowtradition. No more DNA of hard news. Katie Couric was hired awayfrom NBC to anchor a softerEvening News—you might even call itNews Lite. Many from Couric’sToday show team came with her.There ensued a purge of veteranCBS Evening News staffers, andindeed a dismantling throught the entire News Division. Foreignbureaus, staff and budgets were reduced (resulting in greatlydiminished coverage of both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars); manyof the best and most experienced people were either demoted or letgo. A new CBS News was created. It didn’t work. Viewershipnosedived; morale reached an all-time low. After five years, theygave up on the idea. U-turn time. McManus was moved back to hisposition as president of CBS Sports. Jeff Fager was made the newhead of the News (with the title of chairman, not president). He tookthe assignment after apparently being assured that he could tryreturning CBS News to its hard-news origins—at least as far as thenow shrunken News Division could be resuscitated. And from what Ican see, Fager is on the right track. He named Scott Pelley, a hard-charging reporter and a stellar60 Minutes and60 Minutes IIcorrespondent, to replace Couric as anchor and managing editor oftheEvening News. Pelley had worked with me and for me for manyyears, and I had repeatedly suggested him to management as apromising potential successor. I am happy to say that sinceascending to the anchor chair, Pelley has done a superb job, both asan anchor and as a leader. He, Fager and what remains of thetradition-oriented core at CBS News are clearly renewing theirdedication to Core journalism and real reporting.I believe that the free press is essential to the balance of powersin our government. Our system of government was born of a love of freedom and a fear of power concentrated in the hands of one, suchas a king, or a few, such as an aristocracy. We have few princes andearls today, but we surely have their modern-day equivalents in thevery wealthy who seek to manage the news, make unsavory factsdisappear and elect representatives who are in service to their owneconomic and social agendas.The people who wrote the Constitution had foremost in theirminds a system of checks and balances. They set up a system basedon three branches of government—executive, legislative and judicial—that were supposed to counterbalance one another. To thesethree, the Founding Fathers added a fourth: a nongovernmental freepress that was to be the voice of the people, to force government tobe fair, reasonable and democratic.In 1823 Thomas Jefferson put it succinctly: “The only security ofall is in a free press.” Alas, when you have a press that has becomecompliant to politicians, owned by corporations and staffed bypeople who only want to entertain and obey their corporate masters,the plan fails. The “free press” is no longer a check on power. It hasinstead become part of the power apparatus itself. And this isdangerous.In search of a solution to this problem, perhaps we should each—as individual citizens—ask ourselves a group of questions that maylead to some form of action. The following important issues werefirst raised by journalism scholar Lewis W. Wolfson in his book,TheUntapped Power of the Press.• Do we still believe—to paraphrase Walter Lippmann—that it isthe responsibility of the free press to find out what is going on belowthe surface and to tell people what it means, so that citizens canjudge how well or how poorly their government and their leaders areserving them?• Do we still believe that the press in its watchdog role shouldprovide information for and should spur a sensible appraisal ofgovernment, a government’s policies and appraisals of allgovernment at all levels? • Do we understand that no matter how ever-present thereporters are with their cameras and microphones and incessantquestions, that government officials have tremendous—frequentlyoverwhelming—power to manufacture their own reputations? Andthat it is a duty of a free press to present the reality of what agovernment official isdoing, not just saying?• Do we still believe that each American citizen is a stakeholder inthis nation and it is to that public that every elected official isultimately accountable?• Do we still believe that every piece of paper produced by ourgovernment is the property of the people of the United States andshould be accessible to the people—with the exception of nationalsecurity matters and very little else?• Do we still believe that journalists should be the people’ssurrogates in Washington and elsewhere?• Do citizens believe that too many American journalists havebecome at best hesitant and reluctant and at worst frankly fearfuland intimidated?• Do we understand that a war rages daily in American journalismbetween seriousness and sensationalism?• Do we believe that we, the people, need the power of a freepress—battered and tarnished as it may be, damaged partly throughthe efforts of those who despise and fear it and partly throughjournalists’ shortcomings and failures?• Finally, do we understand that a free press is enshrined in theConstitution and the Bill of Rights as an intended and integral part ofthe democratic system of checks and balances?I do not think that it is an exaggeration to say that the future ofour nation—not only journalism, but the country itself—dependsupon our answers and how we choose to act upon them. Some havesuggested intervention by the federal government to strengthen the press. Some have suggested that a committee to study the problembe initiated by the Investigative Reporters and Editors organization.Others have pointed to the work being done at the NiemanFoundation at Harvard University. The Nieman Foundation promoteswatchdog journalism by helping reporters understand whichquestions to ask and of whom, so that those in power give the publicthe information it needs and is entitled to receive. They have alsoestablished the Nieman Journalism Lab to help find a way forinvestigative journalism to survive and thrive in the Internet age. Noanswers yet, of course, but it’s good to know that great minds aresearching for solutions.That said, there is no time to be lost: The corporatization,politicization and trivialization of the press is a serious nationalproblem that grows worse each week. More than anything else, thisproblem needs public scrutiny, awareness and spirited dialogue. AsSupreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis put it, “Sunlight is the bestdisinfectant.” AfterwordSo, why did I want to write this book? And why now?That was perhaps the question asked most often by friends,family, media people, and the public.The answers: At least on my better days, I think I’m a prettygood teller of true stories. After more than sixty years as aprofessional journalist, I think I ought to be, and in truth, I have alot of stories to tell. I also have some strong feelings about what hashappened to American journalism over the years. I believe I knowfirsthand some of the reasons why changes have occurred, and Imust say that I have deep concerns about the future of thisprofession, which I so passionately love. I firmly believe that everyAmerican—not just journalists—should be concerned about it. Butmore about that in a moment.There’s an old cliché that a book is like a child: You conceive it,then you nurse it, nurture it, and teach it—all the while loving it. Butthere comes a point when it must go out on its own. And while yourhopes are high, you also know in your heart that you have no ideawhat its life will be like, nor how long or short its time will be. Youonly know that it will probably surprise you, for better or for worse.This has certainly been my experience in writing books, startingwithThe Palace Guard in 1974. Back then, as a first-time author, Ihad no idea what to expect. But this time around, more than half adozen books later, I did know—or at least I thought I knew—what toexpect. I knew there would be good reviews, bad ones, and onesabout which it would be hard to tell. I knew the rhythms, pace, andsometimes sheer craziness of promotional touring. What I didn’tknow is just how many surprises or how many new twists and turnsthis book experience would bring. Part of that was because during the book’s conception, and wellinto the writing, I was conflicted about a lot of things: On whatshould I focus? In what order should I put it? How much should Iwrite about the Bush episode and the lawsuit connected to it? Andwhere should that go in the narrative?I still can’t decide if I made the right decisions, and perhaps Inever will. But one thing that surprised me is that nobody seemed tocare much about the key questions with which I really grappled.Overall and in the main, readers “got it”; that is, readers thoughtsome version of, “All right, he had to deal with it and did so, but it’snot what the book—the whole book—is about. It’s part, but only apart, of a much larger story.”The major motive for writing the book was not to “set the recordstraight” about the Bush National Guard story. Widely believed thatmay be, but true it is not. As far as I was concerned, it was pasthistory, one of the many lessons I’ve learned from a professionallifetime of being on the line and in the journalistic trenches. It waspart of the ongoing adventure of being a reporter. I was well past it,immersed in a whole new phase of my work, engrossed in the newchallenges and opportunities of doing a weekly news anddocumentary program for Mark Cuban’s cable and satellite network,HDNet.Over the years, I’ve learned that especially in investigativereporting, there’s no room for excuse making, for whining, orblaming bad luck. I took the hit, but quickly got up and got back todoing what I love to do. Part of what kept me going was theknowledge that when one does investigative journalism—especiallyinvolving powerful people and organizations—setbacks go with theterritory.But I knew that I couldn’t do a book and not deal, at least tosome degree, with what had happened as a result of the BushNational Guard story. I couldn’t avoid it, not in a memoir. “Okay, soI’ll have to write something about it,” I said to myself. “I’ll write thewhole saga, beginning to end—the real story, how it happened, andwhy. Put it in the context of what should concern people about thecorporatization, politicization, and trivialization of the news in America, and try to provide some perspective. But I don’t want it todefine the book. I want this book to be more, much more, thanthat.” That is what I tried to do. It took several years, but I felt itfinally was done.The two chapters that people asked the most questions aboutand seemed most interested in were chapters 5 and 6, about thepresidents I have known. Funny thing is these chapters almost didn’tmake the cut. “Probably should be for another book at anothertime,” I had originally thought. What a mistake that would havebeen! Maybe I’ll do a whole book at some point on presidents withwhom I have dealt, but with more detail, context, perspective, anddepth. But what I wrote in this book was certainly worth doing,since, for many readers, it turned out to be their favorite part.I can also say that, based on reaction to the book, Americans aremore interested in the evolution of the presidency and the WhiteHouse—the changing role in our government—than I had thought.That’s a good thing. Few things are more important to the survival ofour constitutional republic based on the principles of freedom anddemocracy than constantly monitoring—and adjusting, whennecessary—the balance between the powers of the executive,legislative, and judicial branches of government.I had hoped but wasn’t sure that the increasing importance ofjournalism’s role as an outside, independent check on the power ofall three branches would resonate with readers. It did. They havepeppered me with encouragement and asked numerous questionsabout it. The interconnections between our breaking the Abu Ghraibstory, the Bush National Guard story, and the efforts of the powerfulto manipulate and control news seems to have interested readers asmuch or more than anything else in the book. To say that I ampleased about that would be an understatement.Much the same has been the reaction to the chapter about Dr.Martin Luther King and covering the Civil Rights movement, on sceneand up close, in the early 1960s. I had written about theseexperiences before (including inThe Camera Never Blinks in 1976)and wasn’t sure whether to have another go at it in this book. Butmy hope was that with the perspective of more years and more experience, there might still be an audience for stories about what itwas like—what it was really like—to be covering that drama in oneviolent place after another. Based on feedback from readers andreviewers, this also was among the more written and commentedabout sections ofOutspoken.On the other hand, I had really thought that the chapter aboutAfghanistan would probably be among those sparking the mostconversation, questions, and maybe even controversy. Wrong.Nobody I know criticized the words about Afghanistan or thought thechapter was poorly done. It was, as best as I can tell, among theleast-noted portions of the book in terms of public reaction.As for reaction to the book from former corporate executives atViacom and CBS, there has been none. Not in public, anyway, andwhatever—if any—there has been in private, I am unaware of it.They may well have subscribed to the idea that to say anythingwould simply call attention to the book and help sell it.Maybe it’s just wishful thinking or that I’m soft-headed andfoolish, but I still like to think that if some in the corporateleadership could do things over again, the situation might have beenhandled differently. I’ve run into a few of them since the book cameout. We’ve exchanged brief hellos or head nods, but nothing more.Among former colleagues within CBS News, I’ve been mildlysurprised and mightily pleased that so many of them have stayed intouch and remained supportive. This has been especially true of off-camera, behind-the-scenes fellow workers, from producers, editors,and writers, to camera crews and studio technicians, and rightthrough to maintenance workers. But it’s also true of many on-camera anchors, correspondents, and reporters. You will understandwhy they aren’t named. They know how grateful I am.CBS News, under Jeff Fager’s leadership, has steadied itself andmade some encouraging moves since the book came out.60 Minutesremains a top ratings-getter, and the ratings-challengedCBS MorningNews has been revamped for the better. TheCBS Evening News withScott Pelley has improved in both content and ratings; still third, butit has moved up some. The news division saw its reputationdiminished because of the corporate-dictated softening of hard news after I left. It still suffers from the constant reduction of resourcesand personnel during recent years but, given those limitations, it hasbeen turned back toward more of the CBS News hard-news tradition.The selection of Pelley to succeed Katie Couric was key. Pelleycontinues to improve and grow as the new “face of CBS News.” So atip of the Stetson to them.Now, if you’re thinking, as some have asked on the book tour,“Any chance you might sometime go back to60 Minutes?” theanswer is no. The fact is corporate leadership has not changed andthat makes such a move—at best—highly improbable. Or, as I havesaid before at other times and in other contexts, the chances are“slim to none, and slim just left town.”Since the book was published, Mark Cuban’s HDNet has mergedwith other interests and has changed its name to AXS TV, with RyanSeacrest as a major partner.Dan Rather Reports remains on cableand satellite channels weekly, available in an estimated 37 millionhomes. We’re still doing what we’ve always done, specializing indeep-digging investigative journalism, hard-edged field reports(especially international stories), and politics. I still have, as Markoriginally committed to, total editorial and creative control of theprogram. We remain Independent with a capital I.We’re now nearing completion of our seventh year on the air,having done more than 250 one-hour programs. Wayne Nelson andElliot Kirschner are still in command under me, carrying a heavy load(including their aged anchorman). Most of the staff that started withthe program are still with it. How long will we remain on the air? Idon’t know. I do know that every day in this work is a joy and achallenge, and that I’m lucky and blessed to have the opportunity.We have also been blessed to have won several awards (Emmys,etc.). And we have been named the top news program on cablemore than once. As they say in Texas, it ain’t bragging if it’s true. Ifyou’d like to see any of our past episodes, they’re available online.President Barack Obama, of course, has been re-elected sinceOutspoken was first published. I was surprised less by this fact butby his margin of victory. I had expected that the vote would bemuch closer; and, in fact, I believed that Obama could well lose, figuring that with the economy still fragile and unemployment high itmight be a Republican year. I also thought Mitt Romney would be astronger, smarter candidate than he turned out to be.Now Obama has a chance—just a chance—to go down as a greatpresident. His first term was insured of being historic because hebecame the first president of color. This second term gives him arenewed opportunity for greatness. To accomplish that, he will needmore boldness and resolve, less caution and timidity (especially asregards big financial and other entrenched interests) than hedemonstrated in the first term. And he’ll need some luck. He needsto catch—and/or make—some big breaks.As he begins, restoring the still-troubled economy and helpingmore to create jobs are his biggest domestic challenges; relationswith Iran and China his major foreign policy ones.What would be changed in the book if I had it to do over? Well,no book is perfect, and there are some things I might change orwrite differently. Nothing major, but a few things here and there.Example: My friend and corporate boss from years ago GeneJankowski, and his friend and fellow corporation leader David Fuchs,have a different view from what I wrote about how and why60Minutes was moved to its present time slot on Sunday night back inthe mid-1970s. They maintain that the shift was made to help theprogram (which it certainly did) and not to kill it off, as I and otherssurmised at the time, and as I suggested in this original book. Geneand David are honest and among the finest broadcasting executivesI’ve ever known. I wish I had talked to them before writing. At aminimum I would have given their recollections of what happenedand why some serious space.But as they say at the card tables and on the sports fields, “Youcan’t play ’em over.” When the game is finished, you can’t changethe scores. So it is with books. You can muse about what might’vebeen and question yourself, but what’s between hardcovers staysbetween hardcovers. Which is why with paperback editions, authorssometimes seize the opportunity to write afterthoughts.Dan Rather January 2013 This Just In…It is the night of the Chinese New Year and, metaphorically, a burstof Chinese fireworks has just exploded all over my Sunday.The Afterword specially written for this paperback edition ofRather Outspoken was at the publisher; the deadline for it was wellpassed when word came—“This just in” fashion—that CBS is buyingan interest in AXS TV, the television home ofDan Rather Reports.I couldn’t have been more surprised if the Dalai Lama had comeloping through the room on a hippopotamus. Frankly, I’m still tryingto get my head around the news even as I hurriedly write this toupdate what I’d already written for the paperback’s Afterword. Sobear with me, dear reader, as I try to take you through the situationas I understand it.After the hardcover edition ofRather Outspoken was published in2012, Mark Cuban, sole owner and hands-on chief of HDNet, sold asizeable but not controlling interest in his network to a group headedby Ryan Seacrest. They renamed it AXS TV. Cuban retained finaldecision-making power over programming in the new enterprise:The idea was that by combining with Seacrest and with some of hisassociates, the former HDNet could grow faster and increase itsexposure and audience. The new, combined ownership rebooted thenetwork, taking it in some new (hopefully improved) directions whilekeeping theDan Rather Reports one-hour weekly news series andsome other holdover programs that had proven popular.Now, roughly eight months after that, CBS has made aninvestment in AXS TV. It’s become a substantial but not controllingpartner and Mark, again, retains final say about programming incooperation with Seacrest and other partners. CBS’s longtime CEO Les Moonves was with Mark and others in themeetings for the deal. It is my understanding thatDan RatherReports was not discussed much, if at all, but that it was marked inAXS TV materials to them as a “show we expect to continue.”I’ve been told that consummation of the deal doesn’t mean therewill be any changes for me or forDan Rather Reports. Markcontinues to express confidence and admiration for the program andhas told me to “just keep on doing what you do.”There you have it, as best I can make it out right now.So, what to think? Well, Mark kept me informed before and afterthe deal was signed. That’s classy and much appreciated. He’s beenup-front, candid, and honest with me since the first time I met himmore than seven years ago, and I have no doubt that he is now.This CBS investment figures to be great for AXS TV, and anythingthat helps grow the network can be good forDan Rather Reports.Mark is excited about it and so am I. After all the work and moneyMark has put into his network, he deserves to have good thingshappen to it. All Mark has ever asked of me is to do greatjournalism, strive to put out the best hour-long news program ontelevision, and not to fear “pissing people off” (his exact phrase)when they deserve it and most especially when they are verypowerful people.When thinking about what is happening now with all of this, twothoughts meander into my mind. The first thought is about thesometimes “circularity of life,” a phrase coined by the late ArthurSchlesinger, another way of saying, “Funny how time sometimesbrings things around in a kind of circle.” The other thought is aparaphrase of what some ancient wise man once wrote: “What wemost expect in life often doesn’t happen, what we least expect oftendoes.”Of all the news I ever thought I might need to discuss in theAfterword for the paperback of this or any other book, CBS and LesMoonves buying a stake in Mark Cuban’s network was so remotelyunlikely it literally never occurred to me. Now, the advice of my lateparents comes back anew: No matter what happens, just keep onkeeping on. And while thinking of that, I’ll know that Mark Cuban is still the best boss I’ve ever had (only Bill Small, when he was chiefof the CBS News Washington bureau and, later, when he was a CBSNews vice president, comes close). Helping Mark in his dedication toprevent real news from becoming extinct on television is a joy and aprivilege.Time and the marketplace will eventually tell us how this worksout. But the journalist in me wanted to share with you what is, atthis writing, breaking news.Dan RatherFebruary 2013 AcknowledgmentsWhen professionals such as Digby and Kay Diehl help as much asthey have with this book, it is not uncommon for authors to try tohide that help. Often the author succeeds. Let me be clear: Thisman-and-wife team were indispensable in helping me get this bookdown on paper and ready for publishing. It’s definitely my book inevery sense, but without their help it may never have come intobeing.Working full time (and then some!) and traveling almostconstantly for a weekly one-hour news program, I was floundering inmy years-long effort to get this book finished. Digby and Kayrescued me and the project. They were incredibly hardworking, loyaland professional to the core.My daughter, Robin, and son, Danjack, gave constant support andencouragement, especially any time my hopes for the book sagged.In the late stages, when deadline pressures seemed insurmountable,Robin’s hands-on work was essential. Her patience in going over themanuscript line by line often exceeded my own.My brother Don and my sister, Patricia Thompson, weresupportive as always. Patricia was especially helpful in obtainingphotos and other materials for the book.Paul Fedorko, friend and literary agent extraordinaire, shepherdedthe project superbly start to finish.I have had the enthusiastic support of Jamie Raab, senior vicepresident and publisher of Grand Central Publishing, from the outset.Rick Wolff, vice president/executive editor, has been the editor everyauthor dreams of, a bottomless fount of encouragement and soundadvice. They were aided and abetted by Meredith Haggerty, MariOkuda, John Pelosi, Giraud Lorber, Jimmy Franco, Anne Twomey,Bob Castillo and countless others at Grand Central. Never have Ibeen so happily published. My dear friend, attorney Martin Gold of SNR Denton, helped meaccurately recall any number of important details. So did friendsDavid and Susan Buksbaum and Suzanne Meirowitz Nederlander.Mary Mapes, one of the most high-flying eagle producers, gavegenerously of her time and her expertise. I owe her another trip toRosie’s. I am also grateful to other former colleagues still at CBSNews. I understand completely why they would prefer not to bementioned by name.Lisa DeVincent deserves a salute. She is not only an excellenttranscriber but a longtime loyal supporter. It was Lisa who first heardthe conversations that eventually became the raw material thatformed this book and was excited about their potential.Mike Hoover, a documentarian and expert on Afghanistan,contributed his expertise. I am also grateful to Eric Wybenga, awriter who helped me in years past. I am greatly indebted to VitaPaladino and her staff at the Howard Gotlieb Archival ResearchCenter at Boston University. They were indispensable, helping me inso many ways.I can’t say enough about my team atDan Rather Reports atHDNet. They have been granitelike in their understanding andsupport. Phil Kim, working in his spare time, kept us all coordinated.Cherisse Cruz backed up both him and me.

const searchTerm = `the case, I asked." Quote from Martin. Yes, but they will have good lawyers who will mount a vigorous defense. Once you file, they will be relentless, and it won't just be in the courtroom. It's possible they will delve into your personal life in that of your family, and whatever they find, be prepared for them to use it against you somehow. Perhaps even national inquiries style. They will harness every ounce of media power they have to make you look bad. Beyond that, they will do everything they can to spend you into oblivion. It's not that CBS as deep pockets, he said, is that they have bottomless pockets. The money they're spending isn't their own. It's the shareholders. I said, if you were in my shoes, would you do it? No, Martin replied.`;
